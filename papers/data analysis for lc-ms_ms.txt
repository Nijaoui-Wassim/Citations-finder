Data analysis is a very challenging task in LC-MS metabolomic studies. The use of powerful analytical
techniques (e.g., high-resolution mass spectrometry) provides high-dimensional data, often with noisy
and collinear structures. Such amount of information-rich mass spectrometry data requires extensive
processing in order to handle metabolomic data sets appropriately and to further assess sample
classiﬁcation/discrimination and biomarker discovery.
This review shows the steps involved in the data analysis workﬂow for both targeted and untargeted
metabolomic studies. Especial attention is focused on the distinct methodologies that have been developed in the last decade for the untargeted case. Furthermore, some powerful and recent alternatives based
on the use of chemometric tools will also be discussed. In general terms, this review helps researchers
to critically explore the distinct alternatives for LC-MS metabolomic data analysis to better choose the
most appropriate for their case study.

1. Introduction
Metabolomics [1–3] is one of the categorical platforms that constitute omics [4] (see Fig. 1). Omics is a ﬁeld that aims at the study
of the abundance and (or) structural characterization of a broad range
of molecules in organisms under distinct scenarios. In the clinical
ﬁeld, high-throughput omic technologies are used for the characterization of diseases to better predict the clinical course of organisms
and to evaluate the eﬃcacy of existing or under-development therapies [5]. In food science, omics plays a signiﬁcant role in the light
of an improvement of human nutrition [6]. In the environmental

ﬁeld, omic studies aim at the evaluation of the alterations that organisms might suffer after exposure to environmental stressors [7,8].
In all cases, the expressed molecules are involved in most crucial
biological processes, and principally comprehend deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (genomics [9], epigenomics [10]), ribonucleic acid (RNA)
(transcriptomics [11]), proteins (proteomics [12]), and other small
molecules (metabolomics [1–3]). In more recent years, another categorical omic platform named ﬂuxomics [13,14], which aims at
the study of the ﬂuxome, or the total set of ﬂuxes in the metabolic
network of the biological specimen, has gained relevance. Apart from
these categorical omic platforms, a variety of omic subdisciplines

have also emerged (e.g., lipidomics [15], glycomics [16], foodomics
[6,17], interactomics [18], and metallomics [19]), showing that omics
is a constantly evolving discipline. Among all these omic platforms, metabolomics is becoming increasingly popular and is used
to detect the perturbations that disease, drugs or toxins might cause
on concentrations and ﬂuxes of metabolites involved in key biochemical pathways [20]. Due to its importance and relevance, the
current study concentrates on metabolomic data.
Several analytical techniques have been developed for each of
the omic platforms (see Fig. 1), including DNA microarray-based
and RNA-sequencing techniques [21], nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy [22,23] and mass spectrometry (MS) methods
[24,25]. In the ﬁeld of metabolomics, both NMR and MS techniques are the most popular. High-resolution proton NMR
spectroscopy (1H-NMR) has proved to be one of the most powerful technologies for examining bioﬂuids and studying intact tissues,
producing a comprehensive proﬁle of metabolite signals without
separation, derivatization, and preselected measurement parameters [26,27]. On the other hand, MS methods, both by direct injection
[28] or coupled to chromatographic techniques [29], have also
evolved into a powerful technology for metabolomics due to their
ability in the analysis of low molecular weight compounds in biological systems. These two approaches (i.e., NMR and MS) are
complementary, and the integration of both technologies to
provide more comprehensive information is now pursued in the
metabolomics ﬁeld. Nevertheless, this study concentrates on MSbased metabolomic data.
Concerning MS instrumentation, high-resolution mass spectrometers are the most powerful analysers due to their ability to
improve accurate mass determination. In fact, spectrometers such
as time-of-ﬂight (TOF) [30], quadrupole time-of-ﬂight (Q-TOF) [31],
and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) [32] spectrometers and orbital ion traps [33], have substituted in many
cases the conventional low-resolution quadrupoles and linear
ion traps (IT), due to their ability to resolve isomeric and isobaric
species and elucidate elemental composition [34]. Regarding chromatographic techniques, early metabolomic studies were commonly
based on gas chromatography (GC), since it is a highly eﬃcient,
sensitive and reproducible technique [35]. However, GC has the
drawback that only volatile compounds or compounds that are
made volatile after derivatisation can be analysed, and extensive
sample preparation is often required. In contrast, high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra high-performance liquid
chromatography (UHPLC) are considered to be more comprehensive than GC since they allow the analysis of a wider range of
metabolites without the requirement of derivatisation [36–39].
Hence, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) has lately gained popularity in the metabolomics ﬁeld in
detriment of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
(GC-MS), this being the reason why this study is focused on the
former technique.
The improvement of analytical techniques has gradually caused
metabolomic data sets to become larger with more intricate inner
structures [40]. Mass spectrometric based techniques generate
highly complex data, due to the vast number of measurements
(i.e., MS spectrum at each retention time) related to the number
of observations (i.e., samples). In the case of LC-MS analysis (see
Fig. 1), data generated from each chromatogram are arranged in
data sets containing information of mass-to-charge (m/z), retention times and intensities. Hence, massive amounts of informationrich MS data are generated in the analysis of every sample, thus
requiring speciﬁc standard approaches for its study and interpretation [41].
In general terms, data analysis strategies are classiﬁed in two
groups: data analysis strategies for targeted (Fig. 2) and untargeted
(Fig. 3) metabolomic studies. The reason for such differentiation is

427

due to the different types of data generated in these two approaches, which require being handled accordingly. Targeted studies
[42] focus the research on a set of known metabolites whereas
untargeted studies [43] allow a more comprehensive evaluation of
metabolomic proﬁles. Most of the methodologies used in early targeted studies just allowed the identiﬁcation of a few number of
metabolites [44]. Nevertheless, recent targeted methodologies enable
large-scale metabolic proﬁling, including hundreds of compounds
[45–47]. However, the number of compounds analysed in untargeted
studies is even larger. This is so because one must process entire
data sets including thousands of metabolite signals, and among these,
few are ﬁnally identiﬁed as candidate biomarkers [48]. Therefore,
data analysis strategies for untargeted studies require highlyextensive processing of LC-MS chromatograms. A large number of
data analysis strategies are found in the literature but none of them
can be singled out as the optimal choice in all cases, which makes
data analysis an open task in the bioinformatics research. In fact,
the ﬁeld of MS-based metabolomics is rather young, and new
methods, software and platforms are being regularly published or
updated [49,50].
A recent review of Yi et al. [51] summarizes recent and potential advances in chemometric methods in relation to data processing
in untargeted metabolomic studies. Various aspects, including raw
data pre-processing, metabolite identiﬁcation, and variable selection and modeling are accurately discussed and presented there.
The present review complements the previous one with some
data analysis steps not covered or partially covered by the former
(e.g., data acquisition, data storage and conversion, data import,
data compression and feature detection or peak resolution), presents novel and little known chemometric tools for data analysis
and includes an overview of the data analysis strategies for targeted studies. Moreover, it is intended to contribute to the stateof-art by providing comprehensive information on bioanalytical
and data processing tools rather than describing the principles of
the chemometric methods that can be used in LC-MS metabolomic
data analysis.
2. General overview of the data analysis approaches
LC-MS metabolomic data analysis strategies are primarily designed for targeted and untargeted studies. However, future advances
in LC-MS metabolomics may lead to a merging of targeted and
untargeted analyses; with the targeted approach providing more
sensitive and accurate detection of predetermined metabolites,
and the untargeted approach being able to detect and identify
unknown metabolites [52]. Indeed, ﬁrst steps in this direction
were made by Savolainen et al. [53], who collected for the ﬁrst
time targeted and untargeted metabolomic data from human plasma
using gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
(GC-MS/MS). Next, a brief introduction to both approaches is
presented.
Data analysis in targeted metabolomics [42] aims to process data
sets coming from a subset of the metabolome: a predeﬁned group
of chemically characterized and biochemically annotated metabolites contained in referential databases. The advantages of performing
a targeted search are mainly attributed to two factors: ﬁrst, analytical artifacts are not carried through to downstream analysis, and
second, just a selected group of metabolites is studied. Even though
this fact facilitates data analysis, the process becomes quite timeconsuming and tedious if one wishes to study a large number of
metabolites. In those cases, in order to reduce the effort and time
required for the data analysis, some alternative automated methodologies have been developed [54–59] (see Section 3.1.5.).
The untargeted approach [43] attempts the comprehensive analysis of all measurable analytes in a sample, including uncharacterized
metabolites. No previous knowledge of the sample is required, and

Fig. 2. Overview ﬂowchart listing the ﬁve steps (grey shaded areas) involved in the
data analysis approach for targeted studies: raw data acquisition, generation of a
referential database, isolation and identiﬁcation of metabolites, normalization and
quantiﬁcation, and biochemical interpretation. These steps are grouped in three major
areas: data aquisition (light-grey), data processing and feature detection (mediumgrey) and interpretation (dark-grey). In this ﬁgure rectangles indicate processing steps,
diamonds indicate key contributional choices and in rounded rectangles are included illustrative representations of MS data and LC-MS chromatograms. Note that
this ﬂowchart does not consider the possibility of using automated data analysis tools
such as MRMPROBS, MMSAT or OpenChrom, which have their own speciﬁc workﬂow (see Section 3.1.5.). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure

no referential database is necessary. However, its comprehensive
nature requires the analysis of whole data sets, which include gigabytes of information. This is not possible without a previous
reduction of their dimensions into more computationally manageable formats, but this compression must be carried out without
signiﬁcantly compromising the experimental information contained within. Moreover, the compressed data need further and
extended analysis in order to ﬁnally detect most discriminant metabolites (i.e., potential biomarkers).
In Figs. 2 and 3 is shown a detailed scheme of the steps involved in data analysis strategies for targeted and untargeted studies,
respectively. As shown in the former, the targeted approach can be
broken down into ﬁve different parts (grey shaded areas): raw data
acquisition, generation of a referential database, isolation and identiﬁcation of metabolites, normalization and quantiﬁcation, and
biochemical interpretation. These parts can be grouped in three
major areas: data acquisition (light-grey), data processing and feature
detection (medium-grey) and interpretation (dark-grey). On the other
hand, in Fig. 3 the untargeted approach is divided in nine parts, regrouped using the same criterion as in Fig. 2: raw data acquisition
(light-grey area), data storage and conversion, import, compression, normalization, scaling and transformation, feature detection
or peak resolution, biomarker screening and identiﬁcation (mediumgrey area) and biochemical interpretation (dark-grey area). Note that
some steps are common in the targeted and the untargeted schemes.
See Section 3 for a detailed explanation of both approaches.
3. The data analysis workﬂow for targeted and untargeted
metabolomic studies
This section provides details of the steps involved in data analysis workﬂows for targeted and untargeted studies (highlighting
common aspects), and ﬁnishes with a common explanation of the
biochemical interpretation for both approaches.
3.1. Data processing steps for targeted studies
3.1.1. Raw data acquisition
Targeted analyses require collecting metabolite speciﬁc information typically using low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry
(LRMS/MS) instrumentation such as triple quadrupole (QqQ) and
quadrupole/linear ion trap (QLIT), which allow proper quantiﬁcation. Both QqQ and QLIT are routinely operated via selected ion
monitoring (SIM) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM). In addition, QLIT permits advanced MS3 functionality together with QqQ
fragmentation patterns, thus, providing more useful information
needed for structural knowledge [52]. Although the use of LRMS/
MS instrumentation is the most popular practice in targeted
metabolomics, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) [60,61]
can also be used in targeted analyses, operating in full-scan.
Acquisition mode of LC-MS data (i.e., centroid or proﬁle, Figs. 2
and 3) is inﬂuential on the ﬁnal identiﬁcation of metabolites. Acquisition in centroid mode was introduced in the early days of MS

E. Gorrochategui et al. / Trends in Analytical Chemistry 82 (2016) 425–442

instrument development, when the amount of data and the data
collection rate overwhelmed the state-of-art data system and data
storage [62]. Consequently, early mass spectrometers (e.g., lowresolution quadrupoles and IT) were designed to reduce the acquired
raw MS data to a stick spectrum, or centroid data, in a process
known as centroiding. Centroiding processes each mass spectrum
and combines multiple data points representing the same peak into
a single data point with one m/z and intensity value. Nowadays, acquisition in centroid mode is no longer mandatory since data
communication rate and storage capacity are not obstacles in most
data systems anymore. In fact, acquisition in proﬁle mode occurs
by default in many HRMS instrumentation.
Centroiding has the obvious advantage of generating lighter data
ﬁles (up to 100-fold smaller). However, centroid data are obtained
at the expense of signiﬁcant information loss, including noise characteristics, linearity of the ion signal, mass spectrally interfering ions
and isotope ﬁne features that can be obtained with HRMS when acquiring in proﬁle or continuum mode. Such information is highly
desirable since it facilitates the differentiation of formula candidates hard to distinguish [62].
For instance, a feature identiﬁcation software named MassWorks
(Cerno Bioscience, http://www.cernobioscience.com) takes advantage of the information gained under proﬁle mode to reduce the
number of possible formula candidates and achieve better results
in the identiﬁcation step [63,64].
3.1.2. Generation of a referential database
As previously stated, targeted metabolomics aims to search for
a speciﬁed list of metabolites, typically focusing on one or more
related pathways of interest [65]. In order to search for the metabolites of interest, the ﬁrst step required is the elaboration of a
referential database containing information of their nominal and
exact mass, chemical formula, retention time and precursor and
product m/z values. As observed in Fig. 2, such referential database can be constructed in two ways. One would be to take beneﬁt
from previous biochemical knowledge or from previous studies performed on the same type of organisms or groups of compounds,
with the help of standard compounds (home-made database). The
other approach consists of consulting retrospectively online
metabolomic databases [e.g., human metabolome database (HMDB),
METLIN, MassBank, LipidMaps & LipidBlast, NIST and mzCloud]. The
readers interested in mass spectral databases for LC-MS metabolomic
data sets are advised to consult the recent work of Vinaixa et al.
[66].
3.1.3. Isolation and identiﬁcation of metabolites
Following the generation of a referential database, next step is
the isolation and identiﬁcation of the target metabolites. Most targeted metabolomic studies use LC-MS vendor software [e.g., Masslynx
(Waters), Xcalibur (Thermo Fischer), Analyst (AB Sciex), Compass
(Bruker), MassHunter and Chemstation (Agilent)] for both isolation
and identiﬁcation of compounds, with the support of the referential database. Only in few cases, data are analysed out of the vendor
software (see Section 3.1.5.).
Identiﬁcation of metabolites is still evolving within the
metabolomics community, with active discussion on how to deﬁne
which features constitute valid metabolite identiﬁcation [67]. Discussing all the identiﬁcation strategies is out of the scope of this
review, and only basic guidance is given. According to the criteria
proposed by the Chemical Analysis Working Group (CAWG) of the
Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI: http://msi-workgroups
.sourceforge.net), four levels of identiﬁcation can be deﬁned [68].
Level 1 refers to deﬁnitive identiﬁcation, possible when having, at
least, two orthogonal molecular properties of the putative metabolite conﬁrmed with an authentic chemical standard analysed under
identical analytical methodology (not necessarily in the researcher’s

429

laboratory). Levels 2 and 3 refer to putative or tentative identiﬁcation so that comparison against literature and data sets is suﬃcient.
Putative identiﬁcation can provide metabolite-speciﬁc (level 2) or
class-speciﬁc (level 3) identiﬁcation. Level 4 refers to unknown compounds. Moreover, in the European Directive 2002/657/EC, the
criteria for unequivocal identiﬁcation of compounds according to
the analytical platform used are presented [69].
As explained in Section 3.1.1., in targeted studies, two platforms can be used to enable proper identiﬁcation of metabolites:
LRMS/MS, which is the most common approach, and HRMS. When
working with LRMS/MS, the standard procedures are SIM and SRM
[70], as they enable high sensitivity, reproducibility and a broad
dynamic range. Signiﬁcant advances have been made to perform
SRM experiments, and routine methods are now available for
analysing most of the metabolites in central carbon metabolism, as
well as amino acids and nucleotides at their naturally occurring physiological concentrations [71–73]. Moreover, most of the currently
existing LRMS/MS targeted methods have been developed to enable
large-scale metabolic proﬁling, including hundreds of compounds.
Sawada et al. [45], optimized the SRM conditions of 497 plant metabolites and ﬁnally quantiﬁed 100 of them in each of 14 plant
accessions from Brassicaceae, Gramineae and Fabaceae. Also, Gu et al.
[47], optimized 595 precursor ions and 1890 SRM transitions for
the analysis of serum metabolites. In most cases, the utilmate objective of these LRMS/MS methods is the screening of targeted lists
of metabolites as potential metabolic signatures for diseases. Indeed,
targeted screening on human plasma was used to reveal citric acid
metabolites and a small group of essential amino acids as metabolic signatures of myocardial ischaemia and diabetes, respectively
[74,75]. The little percentage of studies that use HRMS instrumentation operating in full-scan mode for targeted metabolomics utilize
the mass deviation as the principal criteria for formula identiﬁcation. In those cases, a deviation of 5 ppm is generally established
as the admissible mass error [76–78]. Garanto et al. [60] characterized the mouse retinal sphingolipidome by ultra performance
liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF), operating in full-scan mode, in a targeted lipidomic
study. In that study, quantiﬁcation was carried out using the ion chromatogram obtained for each compound using 50 mDa windows and
positive identiﬁcation of compounds was based on the accurate mass
measurement with an error <5 ppm and its LC retention time, compared to that of standards.
Regardless the instrumentation used for targeted metabolomics
(i.e., LRMS/MS or HRMS), identiﬁcation of metabolites can be enhanced when acquiring data in proﬁle mode, as explained in Section
3.1.1. For instance, Erve et al. [63] and Amorisco et al. [64] used the
advantages of acquiring in proﬁle mode to ensure precise identiﬁcation of compounds.
3.1.4. Data normalization and quantiﬁcation
The aim of normalization is to remove confounding variations
attributed to experimental sources (e.g. analytical noise or experimental bias) in ion intensities among measurements while
preserving the relevant variation (due to biological source). Chemical heterogeneity of metabolites, leading, for example, to distinct
recoveries during extraction or responses during ionization in the
mass spectrometer, makes separation between interesting biological variation and unwanted systematic bias a necessary labor [79].
In order to minimize undesired variations, some considerations must
be taken, which are discussed below.
First, sample analysis for a particular study should be conducted in a randomized sample order, and the data should be
acquired in the same batch on the same day, minimizing internal
variation within a particular study set. Second, single or multiple
surrogates (added to sample prior to extraction), internal standards (IS) (added to sample after extraction), and quality control

For data conversion, other external software (Sashimi Project and ProteoWizard) can be used (see Section 3.2.2. for more information). Note
that in this ﬂowchart only MCR-ALS is presented as the peak resolution method, but other chemometric methods such as PARAFAC, PARAFAC2, ICA, can also be used (see
Section 3.2.8.). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.).

samples (QCs) (i.e., pools of several individuals having comparable characteristics that are injected all along the analytical run) [80]
should be used to normalize concentrations of metabolites among
sample sets and batches.
Quantitative analytical methods have generally relied on the utilization of isotope-labeled internal standards, which can be obtained
following the method of Mashego et al. [81], for each metabolite
analysed. This normalization strategy has been used to investigate
metabolites including glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, amino acids, nucleotides and folates from cells including
Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, yeast and human ﬁbroblasts
[81–86]. Recently, Arrivault et al. [87] have presented the criteria
for the selection of most suitable isotope-labeled internal standards according to the case of study.
Using a set of selected surrogates and internal standards is a good
alternative when a full set of isotope-labeled standards is not available and a single calibration curve for each metabolite cannot be
applied. Actually, these methods fall in the middle between targeted and untargeted approaches and are classiﬁed as semitargeted methods. For instance, Bijlsma and colleagues [88] utilized
three internal standard references for lipid proﬁling representing
most abundant lipid classes in their respective region of retention
time. Also, Sysi-Aho et al. [89], developed the NOMIS (normalization using optimal selection of multiple internal standards) method
using the variability information from multiple IS compounds to ﬁnd
the optimal normalization factor for each individual molecular
species. On the other hand, the use of QCs enables the evaluation
of the analytical platform stability and allows the correction of the
intensity deviation.
Next step following normalization is metabolite quantiﬁcation,
performed by integrating the signals (i.e., peak height or area)
of the target metabolites and building analytical calibration
curves (different analytical strategies such as external calibration
curves with standards, standard addition and internal standard are
possible depending on the case, sample matrix effects, and detector reproducibility). As occurred in the previous step, most of targeted
studies use LC-MS vendor software for metabolite quantiﬁcation,
whereas few of them utilize external tools for automated processing (Section 3.1.5.). Following quantiﬁcation, some statistical tests
may be applied in order to evaluate the signiﬁcance of variations
in peak areas/heights among controls and stressed samples and ﬁnd
most discriminant metabolites (i.e., potential biomarkers). In general,
for targeted metabolomics, basic statistical tests such as Student’s
t-test, analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests like KruskalWallis test may provide adequate statistical means to assess the
presence of a signal and its association with a trait of interest.
However, many metabolomic signals are highly correlated and thus
violate fundamental assumptions of independence for these tests.
In those cases, multivariate methods provide an attractive choice
and also allow for other purposes such as sample classiﬁcation or
discrimination (see Section 3.2.9. where some of these methods are
described). For instance, Bajoub et al. [90] used principal component analysis (PCA) combined with partial least squares-discriminant
analysis (PLS-DA) to classify 25 olive oil samples belonging to ﬁve
different varieties and to build predictive models for varietal classiﬁcation. In this targeted metabolomic study Bajoub and colleagues
could identify the varietal markers for extra-virgin olive oil obtained

from Arbequina, Picual, Cornicabra, Hojiblanca and Frantoio cv. After
quantiﬁcation and assessment of statistical relevance, it is possible to make a biological interpretation of the data. This ﬁnal step
is described together for both targeted and untargeted approaches
in Section 3.3.
3.1.5. Data analysis steps all-in-one: tools for automated processing
Some software tools for the analysis of metabolomic data obtained in targeted studies have been developed. Some of the most
recent are MRMPROBS [55,56], metabolite mass spectrometry analysis tool (MMSAT) [57] and OpenChrom [59]. MRMPROBS allows
metabolome analysis of large-scale SRM experiments. This program
provides a process pipeline from the raw-format import to highdimensional statistical analysis. To convert SRM raw data ﬁles to
ABF (analysis services backup ﬁle) format, MRMPROBS uses an independent and freely available converter at http://www.reifycs
.com/english/AbfConverter/, which supports four vendor formats:
Agilent Technologies (.d), Shimadzu (.LCD), AB Sciex (.WIFF) and
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (.raw). In addition, this software also supports the mzML data format, provided by open-source ﬁle translators
such as ProteoWizard (described in more detail in Section 3.2.2.),
which also allows Waters (.raw) ﬁles to be imported. In order to identify the metabolites, an SRM standard library of 301 metabolites with
775 transitions is available. Such library containing SRM transitions with information of precursor and product m/z values can also
be prepared by users and imported as a txt ﬁle. The output ﬁles of
this software (e.g., data tables, statistical analyses such as PCA) can
be exported in tab-separated text and image formats (JPEG, PNG,
BMP, TIFF and GIF) for PCA. On the other hand, MMSAT is a software platform for automated quantiﬁcation of metabolites from SRM
experiments. This software can be used independent of any MS instrument and is compatible with mzXML converted data (obtained
using open source-ﬁle translators such as Proteowizard) from major
mass spectrometer vendors. It allows automatically detection and
quantiﬁcation of metabolites present across all SRM transitions, such
that no prior knowledge of metabolites is required. The output quantitative data can be exported in tab delimited format to facilitate
downstream statistical analysis and visualization using packages such
as Excel or R. Finally, OpenChrom is an extensible cross-platform open
source software for the analysis of LC-MS data, available free of
charge at http://www.openchrom.net. This approach supports Agilent
data formats as well as XML, mzXML and netCDF open formats and
provides tools to correct baselines, to detect, integrate and identify peaks and to compare mass spectra.
The three automated platforms hereby described, together with
other existing tools such as MRMer [58], appear as an alternative
procedure for researchers who want to analyse LC-MS data out of
vendor software. The readers interested on these types of tools are
advised to consult OMICtools (http://omictools.com) and ms-utils
(www.ms-utils.org) platforms. OMICtools is an online platform for
genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data analysis that contains 11130 tools classiﬁed by omic technologies,
applications and analytical steps. The other platform, ms-utils, provides comprehensive lists of tools, some of them designed for data
visualization and analysis, format conversion, peak picking and
deconvolution, calibration and alignment and retention time
prediction.

3.2. Data processing steps for untargeted studies
3.2.1. Raw data acquisition
Untargeted analysis of LC-MS data is performed using highresolution mass spectrometers such as TOF and orbital ion trap and
hybrid instruments such as quadrupole/Q-TOF and quadrupole/
orbital ion trap [52], operating in full-scan. Only when using GCMS, low-resolution single quadrupoles also permit identiﬁcation of
metabolites in untargeted studies due to the speciﬁc fragmentation pattern of the compounds analysed [91].
Moreover, as previously stated, the acquisition mode of LC-MS
data (i.e., centroid or proﬁle, Figs. 2 and 3) is inﬂuential on the ﬁnal
identiﬁcation of metabolites, which is enhanced with proﬁle data,
since proﬁle acquisition allows the determination of ﬁne isotopic
distributions. See Section 3.1.1. for a detailed explanation.
3.2.2. Data storage and conversion
Once the full-scan LC-MS chromatograms are acquired, the ﬁrst
step required previous to their analysis involves the conversion of
their original proprietary formats, which are diﬃcult to analyse
outside the vendor software, into open data formats that are readable in most standard statistical environments (e.g., MATLAB or R).
Among the existing open data formats, the most popular are XMLbased formats (mzXML, mzData [92] and mzML [93]), netCDF [94]
(also known as ANDI-MS) and classical text ﬁles (e.g., JCAMP-DX [95]
or txt). Most software packages of LC-MS manufacturers have tools
that enable the conversion of proprietary data formats into open
data formats (see Fig. 3). Waters and Thermo Fisher provide vendor
software (Masslynx and Xcalibur, respectively) with speciﬁc tools for
data conversion (Databridge and File converter, respectively).
Databridge tool allows conversion of Waters raw data into netCDF
or ASCII (txt) ﬁles whereas File converter enables the conversion of
Thermo Fischer raw data into ANDI Files (netCDF format) or txt ﬁles
(please refer to a detailed LC-MS data conversion protocol [96]). Also,
Bruker and AB Sciex vendors have developed freely available external software (CompassXport and MS Data Converter, respectively),
which allow the conversion of raw ﬁles (.d and .WIFF format, respectively) into mzXML for Bruker Corporation and into MGF peak
lists or mzML ﬁles for AB Sciex. Finally, data acquired using Agilent
instruments (.d ﬁles) can be directly converted using Chemstation
but MassHunter ﬁles need the use of the ExportMHDataﬁle tool, which
allows the conversion to mzXML format.
In all those cases, some external software (or projects) for data
conversion can be used. On the one hand, the Sashimi Project, included in the trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP) [97] and, founded by
the proteomics group of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle,
contains converters that read different vendor-speciﬁc data and
convert them into mzXML format. Another popular software,
ProteoWizard, contains a set of open-source, cross-platform tools and
libraries for proteomics data analysis, speciﬁcally suitable for reading
and conversion of a large variety of vendor-speciﬁc formats into open
data formats [98]. In particular, ProteoWizard uses a command line
tool named msconvert (available with a graphical user interface as
well), also included in the Sashimi Project, which allows the conversion of vendor formats into several open data formats, including
mzML, mzXML and txt. In Fig. 3, raw data extension formats and
ﬁnal data extension formats of most important LC-MS manufacturers are shown, together with the software options that enable
such conversions. Only when using feature detection packages that
can read proprietary formats [e.g., various forms (X) of chromatography mass spectrometry (XCMS) [99]], data conversion is no
necessary (dashed line in steps 2–3 of Fig. 3).
3.2.3. Data import
Once ﬁles have been converted into open data formats, next step
is their import into the data analysis platforms. As observed in Fig. 3,

when using feature detection packages [e.g., XCMS [99], MetAlign
[100], Markerlynx, MZmine [101,102]], such import is direct since
they contain speciﬁc tools for that purpose. Several feature detection packages have been developed for untargeted MS-based
metabolomic data analysis. The readers interested in these tools are
advised to consult OMICtools (http://omictools.com) and ms-utils
(www.ms-utils.org) platforms. For data analysis performed by researchers, either in MATLAB or R environments, such import is
possible using distinct strategies.
When working in MATLAB environment, the quickest and easiest
method for LC-MS data import is the use of the routines included in
the Bioinformatics ToolboxTM. A step-by-step example providing details
of these routines is shown by Gorrochategui et al. [96]. When working
in R environment, LC-MS data are usually imported by means of the
mzR package available at Bioconductor [103,104]. mzR provides a
uniﬁed interface for most of the open data formats described above
such as mzXML, mzML, mzData and netCDF. The key function of this
package is openMSﬁle which allows exporting the information from
the MS open formats to a format-speciﬁc mzR object with all the MS
raw data and metadata contained in the original ﬁles. Afterwards,
peaks function can be used to extract all MS spectral data into a matrix
to be further analysed. In addition to this possibility for accessing to
MS raw data for the experienced researchers, the mzR package is also
used in the most popular R-based feature detection packages (i.e. XCMS
[99] and MSnbase [104]) for data import.
3.2.4. Data compression and matrix construction
Handling LC-MS data in its raw form is diﬃcult because of their
large size. Thus, data compression is usually necessary to reduce
them into more computationally manageable formats and avoid issues
associated with the limited memory capacity of the computers, but
preventing a loss of experimental information during the process.
In addition to compression, the initial LC-MS data sets containing
scans of unequally spaced masses must be mapped onto matrices
with rows representing each of the scans (i.e., retention times) and
columns representing the same mass values in all samples.
Different methodologies enable data compression as well as their
processing or visualization in its native two-dimensional form.
Among them, the procedures of “binning” and the “search of regions
of interest (ROI)” are the most adequate to the nature of LC-MS data
sets. Apart from these methodologies, in this section we also shortly
describe another strategy that is commonly used together with the
binning compression in order to further reduce data dimensions:
time windowing.
Binning. Binning is one of the most used procedures for raw
LC-MS data compression. The application of binning involves the
transformation of raw data into a matrix representation (x,y),
with retention times in the x-dimension and m/z values in the
y-dimension. Conversion of high-resolution raw mass spectra
into a matrix representation requires the division of the m/z axis
into equidistant sections with a speciﬁc bin size. Thus, the compression of the data and their mapping to a matrix are carried out
at the same time. However, as a consequence, a relevant drawback of the binning procedure is the diﬃculty associated with the
proper selection of the bin size for a particular data set, being
this parameter strongly related to the chromatographic proﬁle. If
the bin size selected is too small, chromatographic peaks might
alternate among bins and thus not be detected due to the loss of
the chromatographic peak shape. On the contrary, if the bin size
is too large, multiple coelutions between peaks can exist, and
small peaks may disappear by the increased noise level. Another
disadvantage of the binning procedure is the loss of spectral
resolution derived from the data compression performed in the
m/z-mode dimension [37].
Fig. 4 shows an example of the binning procedure applied to a
region of an LC-HRMS chromatogram, with a bin size of 0.1 ppm. The

of 0.1 ppm.

intensities corresponding to all m/z values comprised between the
lower limit (m/z1) and the upper limit (m/z1 + 0.1 ppm) are added up
and attributed to m/z1, thus decreasing ﬁle size but also the spectral
resolution.
Regions of interest (ROI). Data compression based on the search
of ROI is an alternative technique to the binning procedure. This
method, ﬁrst presented by Stolt et al. [105], is based on the concept
of considering analytes as a region of data points with a high density
ranked by a speciﬁc “data void”. These ROI contain data from interesting mass traces, which means values with a signiﬁcant intensity
higher than a ﬁxed signal-to-noise ratio threshold (SNRThr). Moreover, ROI must contain a minimum number of consecutive data
points (ρmin) compressed within a particular mass deviation (μ), typically set to a generous multiple of the mass accuracy of the mass
spectrometer. This condition prevents ionic signals or noise to be
considered as an ROI. In Fig. 5a an example of a mass trace for a
particular region of the chromatogram obeying these criteria and
thus, considered as an ROI (ROIi), is represented. As shown in this
ﬁgure, ROIi can be clearly distinguished from low-intensity signals
that are subsequently ﬁltered out. As shown in Fig. 5b, ROI are
searched among all the chromatogram and vectors of distinct length
(depending on the number of ROI found at each retention time) are
obtained. Finally, these vectors are reorganized into a matrix. To do
that, common ROI among all the retention times are grouped and
ﬁnal m/z of each ROI (mzmean) is calculated as the mean of all the
m/z values from the series of data points grouped within the same
ROI. The obtained matrix contains the retention times in the
x-dimension and the ﬁnal mzmean values of ROI in the y-dimension
(Fig. 5c).
With the ROI compression, no loss of spectral accuracy occurs,
as opposed to the binning strategy. ROI strategy was introduced in
the centWave algorithm of XCMS software [99] and it is increasingly used in feature detection packages as a substitute to the
classical binning [37].
Time windowing. This strategy is based on the partition of the
LC-MS chromatograms into distinct regions of time (i.e., time
windows) to be analysed separately [106–108]. It is an additional
step used to further reduce sample size if data compression using
binning is not suﬃcient. The level of compression achieved with
the ROI strategy is generally high enough so that entire chromatograms can be analysed at a time.

3.2.5. Data intensity normalization, scaling and transformation
In untargeted approaches, three strategies can be used for removing the unwanted systematic bias in the measurements: sample
normalization, data scaling and data transformation. Sample normalization is necessary to adjust the differences among samples
whereas data scaling and transformation allow the comparison
among metabolites of distinct samples. Thus, normalization refers
to row-wise corrections (i.e., within chromatograms) whereas scaling
and transformation refer to column-wise corrections (i.e., between
chromatograms).
Sample normalization strategies can be chemical or mathematical. The ﬁrst ones, which are based on the use of a single or multiple
surrogates, internal standards, and quality controls, have been already
described in the targeted approach (see Section 3.1.4). On the other
hand, mathematical normalization strategies use computation
models to achieve the same purpose. A numerical normalization
method based on the use of QCs proposed by Dunn et al. [109] is
the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS). In this method,
each variable in each sample is individually corrected according to
the evolution of its value in the neighbouring QCs. Also, van der Kloet
et al. [110] proposed in 2009 a correction based on the average or
on the median of the QC replicates analysed in different batches.
A novel and alternative method for correction of analytical bias is
common components and speciﬁc weights analysis (CCSWA), originally developed by Qannari et al. [111] and recently used by Dubin
et al. [112] for correction of analytical bias. This method is reported as a good alternative to LOESS signal correction when samples
and QCs do not behave in the same way. Other mathematical normalization strategies are based on the assumption that the signal
of the majority of metabolites is stable. Under this assumption, normalization can be eﬃciently achieved by calculating the relative ratio
of abundance of metabolites respect to all other peaks (e.g., unit
norm [113] and median intensities normalization [114]). However,
these strategies fail when changes in concentration of metabolites
occur due to laboratory system errors and (or) differences among
large scale biological experiments. In these cases, normalization
based on the total chromatogram is not appropriate and can cause
serious data distortions. Another normalization method widely used
is the probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN) [115]. This method
scales all the intensities in a spectrum using the most probable multiplicative factor calculated as the median of the quotients of the

amplitudes of each point in a spectrum and a reference spectrum.
PQN normalization is highly recommendable for cases were size
effects are noticeable, and internal normalization is not suitable since
it destroys relative peak information within the chromatogram.
Scaling methods are data pretreatment approaches that divide
each variable by a factor, the scaling factor, which is different for
each variable. They aim to adjust for the fold differences between
the distinct metabolites by converting the data into differences in
concentration relative to the scaling factor [116]. Depending on the
scaling factor used, scaling methods are divided in two subclasses. The ﬁrst class uses a measure of the data dispersion (e.g.,
standard deviation) as a scaling factor, while the second class uses
a size measure (e.g., the mean). Scaling methods that use a dispersion measure for scaling include autoscaling [117], Pareto scaling
[118], range scaling [119], and variable stability (VAST) scaling [120].
Autoscaling [117], also called unit or unit variance scaling, is the
most used in metabolomics and it provides equal variance to each
variable (i.e., all metabolites have a standard deviation of one). Pareto
scaling [118] is very similar to autoscaling, but instead of the standard deviation, the square root of the standard deviation is used
as the scaling factor. Range scaling [119] uses the range (i.e., difference between minimal and maximal value or concentration of
a metabolite in a set of experiments) as the scaling factor. VAST
scaling [120] is an acronym of variable stability scaling and it is an
extension of autoscaling. Scaling methods based on average value
include level scaling, which converts the changes in metabolite concentrations into changes relative to the average concentration of the
metabolite and Poisson scaling or “square root mean scale”, which
scales each variable by the square root of the mean of the variable. Examples of Poisson scaling to correct MS data effectively are
found in the literature [121,122].
Finally, transformations are nonlinear conversions of the data such
as the log and the power transformation [116]. These methods are
commonly used to correct for data heteroscedasticity [123], which
in the case of metabolomic data refers to non-equal variance uncertainty variations related to some or all metabolites under analysis.
Some of the existing LC-MS feature detection frameworks allow
normalization based on the use of internal standards and scaling.
For instance, the algorithm of MZmine 2 [102], called linear normalizer, divides the height or area of each peak by a normalization
factor, such as the average of peak height, the average of the squared
peak height, the maximum peak height or the total raw signal within
the chromatogram. In contrast, MetaboAnalyst [124,125] performs normalization (to allow comparisons among samples) and
scaling (to allow comparisons of magnitude of features) sequentially. Wu et al. [126] have recently provided a summary of the
reported sample normalization methods used over the past several
years together with their pros and cons. They conclude that for the
appropriate selection of a normalization methodology, the biological system of study must be thoroughly evaluated. In this study,
Wu and colleagues propose two distinct normalization methodologies, one for urine samples and another for cellular extracts.
3.2.6. Feature detection or peak resolution
Feature detection and peak resolution are two closely-related concepts. Feature detection aims to search for features, using the term

E. Gorrochategui et al. / Trends in Analytical Chemistry 82 (2016) 425–442

435

“feature” for a bounded, two-dimensional (m/z and retention time)
LC-MS signal [37]. On the other hand, peak resolution1 aims to identify the pure components responsible for these features, associated
with a pure spectrum or elution proﬁle, after solving some chromatographic problems (e.g. coelutions). Generally, feature detection
is carried out by different algorithms featured in available software. On the other hand, some chemometric methods have also been
developed to resolve second order data such as LC-MS data. Among
them, multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCRALS) [127] has proved to be powerful when dealing with LC-MS
metabolomic data sets [96,106,107,128–133]. The ultimate goal of
feature detection and peak resolution is to distinguish real chemical compounds from false positives (e.g., background noise).
Most of the existing feature detection packages [e.g., XCMS [99],
MetAlign [100] and MZmine [101,102]] require preliminary peak
alignment and usually peak shaping previous to feature detection.
On the other hand, some chemometric methods such as MCR-ALS
allow peak resolution without previous peak correction. A detailed explanation of both methodologies is shown below.

chromatographic peaks of differing width and is widely used in signal
processing and pattern recognition [138], and furthermore is able to
resolve an additional problem concerning feature detection, as it
is the presence of close-by or coeluted peaks. With the CWT analysis, the intensity of every peak is estimated by the maximum value
of the centroid peak in the calculated peak boundaries. The same approach can be used to eliminate noise contributions known as “shoulder
peaks” (small peaks from residues of the Fourier transform calculated by the MS instrument). These contributions can also be removed
by ﬁtting a theoretical model (e.g., Gaussian or Lorentzian).

3.2.7. Feature detection (and alignment)
In most of feature detection software, peak alignment is necessary in order to search for corresponding peaks across distinct
chromatographic runs and compare them between samples. Together with peak alignment, peak shaping is generally applied so
that peaks ﬁnally have a deﬁned and more symmetrical shape,
usually ﬁtting a Gaussian curve to the experimental features.
The search for corresponding peaks is a cumbersome task since
matching peaks usually have differences in m/z and retention time
values [134]. In fact, when searching for matching peaks, some
remarks should be made. First, the differences in the retention time
across samples may be non-linear. Second, a feature in a sample may
have multiple possible matching features based on m/z and retention time values, potentially leading to false matching. Finally, some
peaks may not appear in some samples [49].
Because of the issues mentioned above, different alignment algorithms have been proposed to correct retention time differences
among samples. Considering the most popular feature detection
packages, some of these algorithms can be highlighted. First, the
OBI-warp [135] (ordered bijective interpolated warping) method,
used in the XCMS software, which allows aligning matrices along
a single axis using dynamic time warping (DTW) together with a
bijective (one-to-one) interpolated warp function. Thus, OBI-warp
(ﬁrst used in the proteomics ﬁeld) produces a smooth warping function able to align multiple chromatographic runs. Alternatively, an
alignment method based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC)
[136] algorithm is used in the MZmine 2 [102] software. RANSAC
is an iterative method that allows the estimation of parameters of
a mathematical model by random sampling of the observed data
that could contain outliers. Finally, the combination of RANSAC and
LOESS regression allows the determination of optimal parameters
of the mathematical model for peak alignment. More options for
peak alignment can be found in the review works of Katajamaa [79]
and Bloemberg [137]. Concerning peak shaping, some feature detection algorithms initially used models of speciﬁc peak width to
ﬁt features (e.g. Matched Filter algorithm of XCMS software [99]).
However, those models failed when the selected peak width did not
ﬁt all features properly.
In order to overcome this issue, some feature detection packages
(e.g., centWave algorithm of XCMS) use continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to perform peak shaping. The CWT reliably detects

It is seen that MCR-ALS methods share the underlying bilinear mathematical model of PCA but under completely different constraints and
with a different goal. In the case of LC–MS data, D matrix (I × J) contains the MS spectra at all retention times (i = 1, . . . I) in its rows, and
the chromatograms at all spectra m/z channels (j = 1, . . . J) in its columns.
This data matrix is decomposed in the product of two factor matrices, C and ST. The C (I × N) matrix contains column vectors which
correspond to the elution proﬁles of the N (n = 1, . . . N) pure components of matrix D. In ST (N × J) matrix, row vectors correspond to the
spectra of the N pure components. The part of D that is not explained by the model forms the residual matrix, E (I × J). MCR-ALS
methods assume that the variation measured in all samples in the
original data set can be described by a combination of a small number
of chemically meaningful proﬁles. In the case of LC–MS data sets, information of the data table can be reproduced by the combination of
a small number of pure mass spectra (row proﬁles in the ST matrix)
weighted by the concentration of each of them along the elution direction (the related chromatographic elution peaks, column proﬁles
in C). As a result from the MCR-ALS analysis, we obtain a set of components, with their corresponding elution and spectra proﬁles. The
equivalence between an MCR-ALS component and a feature is high
since both of them correspond to a chemically meaningful proﬁle.
However, they differ in the fact that one feature is associated with a
unique m/z value whereas one MCR-ALS component can be associated with various m/z values (i.e., distinct m/z values can describe
the same elution proﬁle).
As previously stated MCR-ALS analysis allows powerful LC-MS
data resolution without previous peak alignment or shaping. The
reason why peak alignment is not required is attributed to the fact
that alignment is produced in the spectral dimension (m/z values),
which is common among all samples, and not in the time dimension, which can vary among samples. This is useful with LC-MS data
sets, but even more with capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) data sets, which contain analytes showing important
retention time peak shifts among samples that in some cases cannot
be properly corrected when using feature detection (and alignment) algorithms. The number of MCR-ALS models required to
resolve peak signals of one sample depends on the size of the data
matrix. Generally, for data compressed using binning strategy, compression is not suﬃcient, and MCR-ALS has to be applied individually
to distinct time windows of the chromatogram (see Section 3.2.4.).
On the contrary, when using ROI strategy, the obtained data matrices are small enough so that one MCR-ALS model is generally
suﬃcient to resolve peak signals of the entire chromatographic
proﬁle. The readers interested in MCR-ALS analysis are advised to
consult http://www.mcrals.info/.

1 The term “deconvolution” is analogue to “resolution” but is preferred to be used
for univariate signals [i.e., ﬁrst order data (data vector)], whereas resolution is preferred for multivariate signals [i.e., second order data (data matrix)].

3.2.8. Peak resolution (without alignment)
Recently, some little explored but highly useful chemometric tools
have proved to be powerful methods for LC-MS metabolomic data
analysis. Among them, MCR-ALS has emerged as a powerful tool to
resolve the proﬁling problems in LC-MS metabolomic data sets without
previous peak correction [127]. MCR-ALS is based on Equation (1):

D = CST + E

(1)

436

There are signiﬁcant differences between the approaches used
by MCR-ALS respect to other feature detection packages, such as
XCMS, concerning peak resolution and feature detection strategies. However, a study based on the evaluation of changes induced
in rice metabolome by Cd and Cu using LC-MS [132] concluded that
both methodologies provided similar results, which suggests that
despite the existing differences among these approaches, they are
equally valid to analyse LC-MS metabolomic data sets.
Apart from MCR-ALS, other methods for the processing of secondorder data are available. Among them, PARAFAC (parallel factor
analysis) [139,140], TLD (trilinear decomposition), PARAFAC2 (parallel factor analysis2) [141,142] and independent component analysis
(ICA) are some methods proposed for the same goal. PARAFAC and
TLD methods require the data to follow the so-called trilinearity
model (i.e., all chemical components are deﬁned by a unique elution
and spectral proﬁle in all samples, apart from a scale factor).
However, LC data do not obey the trilinear model in general, since
analyte peaks usually show retention time shifts and peak shape
changes from sample to sample, causing trilinearity deviations. In
order to restore the trilinearity, PARAFAC and TLD methods should
mathematically pre-process each data matrix, so that analyte peaks
are properly aligned. Even in this case however, possible run to run
peak shape differences compel the fulﬁllment of the trilinear model
in many circumstances. On the other hand, PARAFAC2 employs a
more ﬂexible algorithm, which permits a given component to have
different time proﬁles. A study of Khakimov et al. [143] demonstrated the eﬃciency of PARAFAC2 for exploring complex plant
metabolomics LC-MS data. In that study, PARAFAC2 enabled
automated resolution and quantiﬁcation of several elusive chromatographic peaks (e.g., overlapped, elution time shifted and low
s/n ratio). However, Bortolato and Olivieri [144] compared the performance of PARAFAC2 and MCR-ALS, arriving at the conclusion that
PARAFAC2 produces artiﬁcial outputs when elution proﬁle changes
are severe, and interferents are present in test samples and therefore, conﬁrmed the higher power and range of applicability of MCRALS. Another alternative to PARAFAC, PARAFAC2, TLD methods and
MCR-ALS is ICA. The main idea of ICA [145] is to ﬁnd a mathematical transformation of the data into a linear combination of
statistically independent components. However, the condition of independence is generally not fulﬁlled when using ICA with
chromatographic data [146,147]. Among ICA methods, mean-ﬁeld
ICA (MFICA) [148] is the best for multivariate resolution, due to the
application of non-negativity constraints in both data modes (i.e.,
concentration and spectra proﬁles), and is the only one that can be
strictly compared to MCR-ALS. However, the advantage of MCRALS is that it is more ﬂexible since it allows the implementation
of other constraints (e.g., unimodality, closure, local rank, selectivity or the multi-linear type of constraint) [146]. Recently, Liu et al.
[149] have developed a new method named MetICA, inspired from
the original Icasso algorithm, for the application and validation of
ICA on untargeted metabolomic data sets. In that study, the eﬃcacy of MetICA routine was tested on simulated and real MSbased yeast exo-metabolome data.
3.2.9. Biomarker screening or variable selection
Biomarker screening (variable selection) plays an essential role
in metabolomics [150,151]. Biomarkers are deﬁned as biological entities that can be used to indicate the status of healthy or diseased
cells, tissues, or individuals. Thus, they correspond to molecular
markers (i.e., metabolites in the case of metabolomics) that can better
discriminate among control and stressed samples, in terms of their
concentrations.
However, it is unfortunately quite easy to ﬁnd markers that,
despite being apparently relevant, are in fact spurious. The main
sources of error in this aspect, which are not entirely independent
of each other, include bias, inadequate sample size (especially relative

to the number of metabolite variables and to the required statistical power to prove that a biomarker is discriminant), excessive false
discovery rate due to multiple hypothesis testing, inappropriate
choice of particular numerical methods, and overﬁtting (generally
caused by the failure to perform adequate validation and crossvalidation). Many studies fail to take these problems into account,
and thereby fail to ﬁnd anything signiﬁcantly true [152]. For instance, classical p-values such as “p < 0.05” that are commonly used
in biomedicine are far too optimistic when multiple tests are done
simultaneously (as occurs in metabolomics) [150]. Indeed, one type
of bias, known as “p-hacking”, occurs when researchers collect or
select data or statistical analyses until nonsigniﬁcant results become
signiﬁcant. Head et al. [153], studied the extent and consequences
of p-hacking in science arriving at the conclusion that this type of
bias probably does not drastically alter scientiﬁc consensuses draw
from data analyses. However, methods to measure such error and
to correct them are highly recommendable.
The classical methods used for biomarker selection were proposed by statisticians and were based on the application of statistical
hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, ANOVA).
However, other methods envisaged for biomarker screening have
been proposed lately by numerous chemometricians. Some of these
methods include PCA [154], ICA [145], PLS-DA [155], linear logistic regression (LLR) [156], classiﬁcation and regression trees (CART)
[157], selectivity ratio (SR) [158,159] and variables importance on
projection (VIP) [160]. Another method valid for variable selection is ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) [161,162].
This method can be understood as a direct generalization of ANOVA
analysis of variance for univariate data to the multivariate case. ASCA
method incorporates the information of the structure of data sets
(i.e., underlying factors such as time, dose or combinations thereof),
enabling a better understanding of their biological information.
To date, the most popular variable selection method in
metabolomics is the VIP [160] method. However, the main drawback of this approach is related to the proper selection of the
threshold value. Despite some studies select variables with VIP scores
greater than 1 [163,164], such criterion is not always used and the
results found in the literature are not always comparable. A study
by Gorrochategui et al. [108] compared the number of biomarkers
found when using an ANOVA test (p < 0.05) followed by a multiple comparison’s test and those obtained when using the VIP method
ﬁxing distinct threshold values. As it was observed, the number of
encountered biomarkers was different in each case, although some
of them were common among the strategies. Another method facing
the challenge of a proper threshold value selection is SR. Actually,
the use of the threshold suggested by the authors Rajalahti et al.
[158,159] based on an F-test to deﬁne the boundary between variables with high discriminating ability and less interesting regions,
is unusually valid for raw large chromatographic data sets, such as
LC-MS metabolomic data sets [165]. In those cases, SR can lead to
a selection of a reduced number of variables, sometimes not including relevant biomarkers. An alternative strategy to increment
the number of selected variables using SR method is the use of ad
hoc limits (e.g., average SR over the training set).
Despite the VIP method being the most used in metabolomic
studies, there is still some disagreement about which is the best approach for variable selection and a critical evaluation needs to be
performed before any of them is selected and, also, once the results
have been obtained. Checa et al. [166] concluded that the most
crucial step when performing lipidomic data analysis is the proper
choice of the chemometric variable selection method according to
the crude data. Studies comparing the performance of several of
these methods exist in the literature. For instance, Farrés et al. [165]
compared SR and VIP variable selection methods observing that in
general terms, the VIP method selected a higher number of variables than the SR method. However, they arrived at the conclusion

E. Gorrochategui et al. / Trends in Analytical Chemistry 82 (2016) 425–442

that ﬁnal decision about which is the best approach should be performed according to the aim of the study. Also, Andersen et al. [167]
concluded that in essence, variable selection should rather be considered as variable elimination where the clearly irrelevant parts
are removed and the remaining parts containing potentially useful
information are kept for further data analysis.
In order to ensure good performance of the selected discrimination model, further statistical validation of the model is required.
Such validation becomes particularly necessary in the case of
“undersampling” (i.e., when having a low number of samples compared to the number of variables), since the reduced number of
samples becomes insuﬃcient to properly describe the groups and
ﬁnd signiﬁcant biomarkers. Some of the statistical validation tools
that can deal with this problem consist of permutation tests [168],
single and double cross-validation [169,170], and the combination of the latter with a new variable selection method, called ranked
products [171]. Permutation tests give information about the discrimination performance of the model, which should at the same
time be able to properly classify new samples as “stressed” or
“control”. However, testing the classiﬁcation ability of the model
is impossible when having low number of samples and for this
reason, permutation tests are mostly used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the discrimination. Double cross-validation takes a better
advantage of the data and is the chosen method to estimate the error
of the model in classifying unknown samples. Cross-validation procedures generate several models. However, those procedures only
give a reliable error rate when the complete modelling step is crossvalidated. Cross-validation methods together with bootstrap [172]
and jack-kniﬁng methods are classiﬁed as resampling methods [173],
and are used to determine the optimal number of components in
a partial least squares (PLS) regression model [174,175]. Moreover, these methods allow the estimation of the uncertainty of
individual variables, in order to ﬁnd the relevant ones (e.g., relevant VIPs to determine candidate biomarkers). Afanador et al. [176]
demonstrated how the use of bootstrapping, in conjunction with
permutation tests and the use of 95% lower-bound on the jackknife conﬁdence interval provide avenues for improvement of the
important variable selection process. Finally, the rank products procedure can be described as a natural partner for cross-validation
to evaluate the overall importance of a variable. Overall, a combination of these tools for statistical validation of discriminant models
is frequently the best option. Smit et al. [171] presented a strategy
for the discovery and rigorous statistical validation of candidate
biomarkers for proteomics based on the combination of principal
component discriminant analysis (PCDA), permutation tests, double
cross-validation and variable selection with rank products. A tutorial of validation tools for chemometric models shows how the
selection of the level of validation and the method for analyzing data
may impact the conclusions and chemical insight gained [173].
3.2.10. Biomarker identiﬁcation
As stated in Section 3.1.3., the identiﬁcation of metabolites is a
complex task, and it becomes even more complicated in untargeted
metabolomic studies. In 2013, Dunn et al. [177] reviewed all the
available experimental and computational tools to identify metabolites in untargeted metabolomic studies. In this review, they
concluded that the number of identiﬁed metabolite features has increased in the last decades due to enhanced mass spectrometry and
increased mass resolution, but the proportion of identiﬁed metabolites remains still low (ca. 50%). The criteria [68] and directives
[69] for the identiﬁcation of MS data previously presented in the
targeted approach are also valid for the untargeted approach. In contrast to targeted studies which can use either LRMS/MS or HRMS
instrumentation, untargeted studies are possible with HRMS or highresolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS). Li et al. [178]
have recently reported that liquid chromatography coupled to

437

quadrupole time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) to investigate natural products provides eﬃcient separation and good
sensitivity. Also, it allows for the identiﬁcation of the fragmentation pathways of metabolites [179] and [180], by employing newer
mass spectrometryElevated energy (MSE) methods to acquire MS/MS
(without speciﬁc precursor ion selection) data at both low and high
energy from a single injection [181]. Moreover, LC-QTOF-MSE is
proved to be a very versatile technique in metabolomics and it has
been shown to be increasingly powerful [182].
However, the high mass accuracy provided by HRMS instrumentation can be partially lost when using binning in the compression
step (see Section 3.2.4.). In those cases, HRMS data can be recovered using two approaches.
First, HRMS data can be obtained by looking back in the raw
spectra: after the peak resolution step (for instance using MCRALS) has been performed on data compressed by binning, those
peaks tagged as potential biomarkers are identiﬁed by direct comparison with the HRMS spectra. For instance, Bedia et al. [133]
identiﬁed the lipid species (including phospholipids, sphingolipids,
glycosphingolipids and cardiolipin species) altered after longterm exposure of prostate cancer cells to endocrine disruptors using
this approach, even though original data were binned with an m/z
resolution of 0.05 ppm. The second method consists in a leastsquares step which allows HRMS spectra to be obtained from the
MCR-ALS elution proﬁles of binned data and the original HRMS data
for a set of LC-MS chromatograms (or the same region of the chromatogram in the case of time windowing). See Appendix A for a
detailed explanation of the latter procedure. It should be noted that
since the ROI method, used in many of the LC-MS feature detection packages, does not decrease the resolution of the MS data, there
is no need for applying these strategies when this compression technique is used. Finally, as stated in Section 3.1.3., another aspect can
contribute to an enhanced identiﬁcation: acquisition in proﬁle mode.
3.3. Final common step: biochemical interpretation
The overall process of LC-MS data analysis ends with the ultimate biological interpretation of the results through the elucidation
of the metabolic pathways linked to the identiﬁed biomarkers. In
targeted metabolomic studies that are driven by an initial biological hypothesis, ﬁnal interpretation is usually reduced to a
conﬁrmation of the predicted alterations. Only in those cases where
initial predictions are not fulﬁlled the unknown altered pathways
have to be deciphered. In untargeted metabolomics elucidation is
always necessary.
Altered metabolic pathways can be deciphered by consulting
online databases such as KEGG (kyoto encyclopedia of genes and
genomes) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html) [183], Biocyc
(http://biocyc.org) [184], MetaCyc (http://MetaCyc.org/) [185] or
WikiPathways (http://www.wikipathways.org) [186,187]. The representation of these altered pathways in global maps showing an
overall picture of metabolism helps to obtain a reliable biological
interpretation of the studied system. For instance, Farrés et al. [107]
and Ortiz-Villanueva et al. [131] studied the metabolic changes occurring in stressed baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) samples.
With the help of KEGG database both studies characterized most
discriminant metabolites and identiﬁed the metabolic pathways with
the highest participation in the acclimatization of baker’s yeast cells
to grow at distinct temperatures (i.e., 42 and 37°C, respectively). Also,
Chu et al. [188], studied the therapeutic mechanism of Rhizoma
Alismatis, a crude herb component in traditional Chinese medicine, on spontaneous hypertensive rats using ingenuity pathway
analysis (IPA). With the help of KEGG, HMDB and METLIN databases the authors found the potential biomarkers and potential target
pathways of Rhizoma Alismatis species. Moreover, Perl et al. [189]
studied the mechanism of impact of the amino acid precursor,

438

N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on the metabolome of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients by quantitative metabolome proﬁling of
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) using mass spectrometry. The
results of this study showed that metabolome changes in lupus PBL
affected 27 of 80 KEGG pathways with most prominent impact on
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which reﬂected greater
demand for nucleotides and oxidative stress. Overall, their ﬁndings contributed to the identiﬁcation of novel metabolic checkpoints
in lupus pathogenesis.
4. LC-MS metabolomic data analysis: an active area in
bioinformatics research
The development of tools for data analysis is an active area of
bioinformatics research. Recent years have witnessed the development of many software tools for data analysis, but still there is a
need for further improvement of the data analysis pipeline. Such
improvement should concentrate on two aspects: combination of
data analysis strategies and fusion of distinct omic ﬁelds.
The combination of various data analysis strategies is necessary to allow a more comprehensive detection of chemical
components in LC-MS data for signature discovery. In the last years,
some studies have demonstrated the advantages of combining
various data analysis strategies. For instance, Coble and Fraga [190]
compared the performance of four data analysis tools [i.e., XCMS
[99], MetAlign [100], MZmine [101,102], and SpectConnect (this one
for GC-MS data)] in terms of their ability to detect components in
the chromatography-mass spectrometry data sets, arriving at the
conclusion that each of them has its pros and cons. The same study
also pointed out that the most pressing improvement needed for
all the tested data analysis tools was to reduce the percentage of
false peaks, i.e., reported features that are not true peaks, while still
detecting the low-intensity peaks. Moreover, some of the existing
data analysis methodologies still require a signiﬁcant level of manual
input, which diﬃcults the process and can even make it prohibitive in the case of very large data sets.
The fusion of distinct omic platforms (e.g., transcriptomics,
proteomics and metabolomics) is one of the latest objectives pursued
by the omics community. Data fusion is a challenging task, in particular, when the goal is to capture underlying factors and use them
for interpretation. Numerous strategies have been proposed for integrating data from parallel sources. Among them, some of the most
used include GSVD (generalized singular value decomposition) [191],
O2PLS (two-way orthogonal projections to latent structures) [192],
OnPLS (multiblock orthogonal projections to latent structures) [193],
DISCO-SCA (distinctive and common components with simultaneouscomponent analysis) [194], JIVE (joint and individual variation
explained) [195], and CMTF (coupled matrix and tensor factorization) [196]. GSVD provides a comparative mathematical framework
for two data sets (e.g., two genome-scale data sets). O2PLS method
is build on the basis of orthogonal projections to latent structures
(OPLS) [197], which is a supervised multivariate regression method.
O2PLS can be used for combining “omics” types of data, separating systematic variation that overlaps across analytical platforms
from platform-speciﬁc systematic variation. Bouhaddani et al. [198],
evaluated the eﬃcacy of O2PLS in the integration of metabolomic
and transcriptomic data from a large Finnish cohort (DIGLOM). The
results of the simultaneous analysis with O2PLS on metabolome and
transcriptome data were in agreement with an earlier study and
showed that the lipo-leukocyte module, together with two lipoproteins, were important for the metabolomic and transcriptomic
relation. An extension of O2PLS to the multiblock case (involving
more than two matrices) was later developed and called OnPLS.
OnPLS method is fully symmetric (i.e., it does not depend on the
order of analysis when more than two blocks are analysed) and has
been used in several multi-omic studies [193,199,200]. DISCO-SCA

allows distinguishing common and distinctive information in different data blocks; information that is mixed up when using
simultaneous-component and multigroup factor analysis methods.
JIVE [195] was created for the integrated unsupervised analysis of
metabolomic proﬁles from multiple data sources. This method separates the shared patterns among data sources (i.e., joint structure)
from the individual structure of each data source that is unrelated
to the joint structure. CMTF successfully captures the underlying
factors by exploiting the low-rank structure of higher order data
sets and is particularly useful for joint analysis of heterogeneous
data. Apart from these methods, Blanchet and Smolinska [201] have
recently proposed a framework which allows the combination of
multiple data sets, provided by different analytical platforms. This
framework extracts relevant information for each platform in the
ﬁrst step. Then, the obtained latent variables are fused, analysed,
and the inﬂuence of the original variables is ﬁnally calculated back
and interpreted. Therefore, new advances in data processing tools
should point to opening ﬁelds such as data fusion. For instance, in
the case of MCR-ALS, data fusion can be easily performed by augmenting data matrices in the row-wise dimension, and some work
is now being pursued in this direction.
5. Concluding remarks
From a general point of view, we can conclude that the complexity of LC-MS metabolomic data and the diversity of strategies that
are used for their processing makes data analysis an open ﬁeld in the
bioinformatics research. In global terms, targeted strategies allow highly
sensitive and accurate detection of predetermined metabolites whereas
untargeted strategies are valuable for the detection of unknown metabolites and biochemical pathways. However, both approaches are
complementary and can be used simultaneously. Despite recent targeted methodologies enable large-scale metabolic proﬁling, including
hundreds of analytes, the number of compounds to be analysed in
untargeted studies is still larger. This is so because entire data sets
including thousands of metabolite signals have to be processed in
the latter approach. For this reason, later advances in data analysis
tools have been focused on the untargeted approach.
In the last years, multiple feature detection software tools for
LC-MS data have been developed for untargeted metabolomics.
Generally, all of them cover the same steps of data conversion, compression, normalization, feature detection, variable selection and
identiﬁcation. Among them, data compression is one of the most
crucial steps, since it must reduce the original dimensions of the
data (gigabytes of storage) while avoiding any loss of spectral accuracy. Nowadays, the search of ROI has been reported as a better
alternative to the classical binning and it is used in most of these
feature detection software during the compression step.
Novel chemometric tools such as MCR-ALS have demonstrated
to be powerful tools to analyse LC-MS metabolomic data sets and
they are presented in this review as a complement to the existent
feature detection packages the use of which can also provide some
beneﬁts. The principal advantages of MCR-ALS methodology compared to other feature detection algorithms can be mainly attributed
to two aspects. First, MCR-ALS can resolve the coelution chromatographic problems and directly obtain the pure spectra and elution
proﬁles of most of the meaningful metabolites present in the sample.
Second, neither peak alignment nor shaping corrections are necessary for this approach, since LC-MS chromatograms are only
matched in the mass spectral direction, which is reproducible. Thus,
MCR-ALS is considered and proposed as a novel and effective methodology for LC-MS metabolomic data analysis.
Although all data analysis approaches presented in this
review have contributed to increasing knowledge in the LC-MS
metabolomics ﬁeld, more recent advances in new areas such as data
fusion are still necessary.
