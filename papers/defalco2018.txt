Abstract The interest in using the ‘-omics’ approach
for nutrition, agriculture, food science and human
health have seen an explosive growth in the last years.
Particularly, metabolomics analysis is becoming an
integral part of a system biological approach for
investigating organisms. In this review, the limitations
and advantages of NMR spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry were discussed in details using the study
reported in the literature on different Salvia species (S.
hispanica, S. miltiorrhiza, S. officinalis, S. runcinata
and S. stenophylla). Both approaches identify and
quantify several classes of compounds but not the
complete metabolite profile of the plant. A combined
approach of these two powerful techniques provides
better results allowing to determine both primary and
secondary metabolites.

biological research purpose. The development of
analytical instrumentations, data processing and
chemometric tools simplify the study of complex
biological systems on a large-scale. Metabolomics,
together with other ‘-omics’ disciplines such as
genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, is becoming an integral part of a system biological approach for
investigating organisms. Figure 1 reports the classification of the ‘-omics’ technologies and the correlation
among them. Although transcriptome represents the
process for protein synthesis, an increase in mRNA
levels does not always correspond to an increase in
proteins due to a number of post-transcriptional
regulation mechanisms (Kendrick 2014; Vogel and
Marcotte 2012). Therefore, changes in transcriptome
or proteome do not always reflect alterations in
biochemical phenotypes. For this reason, the association of metabolomics to the other analytical areas of
genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics constitute a
very powerful tool to study biological systems.
Metabolomics is the ‘-omic’ studying the whole
metabolome in a cell, tissue or organism from both
qualitative and quantitative point of view. The interest
in using metabolomics for nutrition, agriculture, food
science, human health and drug discovery has seen an
exponential increase in the last years. In fact, the
number of publications containing the term ‘‘metabolomics’’ is constantly growing.
In the whole metabolome, there are two groups of
compounds, primary metabolites and secondary ones.
Primary metabolites are ubiquitous compounds

involved in the basic functions such as respiration,
growth and maintenance of a cell. Basically, all
organisms share the same type of primary metabolites.
Secondary metabolites are non-ubiquitous and thus
species specific compounds playing a role in the
interaction of a cell with other cells or with the
environment. Secondary metabolites are responsible
of plant flavours and colours and are associated to
plant resistance against pests and diseases.
The chemical complexity of metabolites ranges
from ionic inorganic species to complex organic
products, from hydrophilic to lipophilic compounds,
from volatile to non-volatile molecules and from low
to high molecular weight metabolites. Their production is not only regulated by gene expression but also

123

by environmental conditions and it is for this reason
that the metabolomics is able to define the biochemical
phenotype of the studied subject.
During the metabolomics analysis, both primary
and secondary metabolites will be detected after a
snapshot of the entire metabolome and relative or
absolute quantification can be done. This approach is
applied on several topics which include:
•

•

Studying fingerprints of different species, varieties, genotypes or ecotypes to obtain more
information about taxonomy or biochemistry
(Brahmi et al. 2015; de Falco et al. 2016).
Comparing several classes of metabolites in
response to external chemical or physical treatments (Catola et al. 2016; de Falco et al. 2017b).

Highlighting differences and similarities between
the metabolite content of mutants or transgenic
plants and their wild-type counterparts (Kristensen
et al. 2005).
Monitoring developmental processes such as
metabolic transition from immature to ripe fruit
(Aharoni et al. 2002).

Generally, in the metabolomics studies there are
four critical steps (Fig. 2). The first one is sample
preparation. At this step, it is necessary to control time
and temperature which influence the accuracy and the
reproducibility of results. Metabolic reactions are
extremely rapid, so the freezing and the storage of
samples at - 80 C are required.
The second step is the extraction procedure aiming
to maximize the number and the content of metabolites of interest. A recent study on Arabidopsis
thaliana showed that a particular combination of
MeOH/H2O/CHCl3 is the best solvent mixture in

comparison to others (Gullberg et al. 2004). Ultrasonic
treatment is also used as a disruption method to reduce
the time and to improve the efficiency of the
extraction.
Following this, a third step is the use of several
detection techniques to analyse the extracts. A high
amount of information is generated by analytical data
acquisition and compounds identification; therefore,
data analysis is the fourth crucial step, briefly discuss
in paragraph 1.3. A further separation or purification
of metabolites after their extraction is also possible,
but in many applications, samples are analysed
directly. Whether this intermediate step is necessary,
depends on the kind of research that is done. Nowadays, two main strategies are used for metabolomics
investigations: untargeted (non-targeted) metabolomics and targeted metabolomics. The untargeted
approach aims to compare the whole metabolite
profiles among different sample groups, whereas
targeted metabolomics focuses on a tiny fraction of

123

954

the metabolome analysing a specific group of compounds related to a specific metabolic pathway (e.g.,
fatty acids, amino acids or phytochemicals) (Son et al.
2008; Vrhovsek et al. 2012). For this purpose, one or
few metabolites are selected after a high number of
purifications and all other compounds are ignored.
This approach is used to study know compounds and
to get general information on the presence of unknown
compounds in the analyzed material. However, to
determine the chemical structure of compounds never
reported in the literature it is necessary to obtain them
as pure metabolites and to subject them to the classic
spectroscopic and chemical analytical method.
Metabolomics aims to identify and quantify the
overall metabolome. To achieve this objective, several
analytical approaches can be used, each of them with
advantages and disadvantages. They can be grouped as
follows:
•

•
•

chromatographic methods: liquid chromatography
(LC), high-performance LC (HPLC); ultra-high
performance LC (UHPLC), gas chromatography
(GC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), thin layer
chromatography (TLC);
mass spectrometry (MS);
spectroscopy: nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR); fourier transform infra-red (FTIR); ultraviolet methods (UV).

Each technique, mentioned above, can be applied at
two different levels. The first level is a qualitative
study in which the signals observed are assigned to
specific metabolites with the help of standard compounds, data literature and different libraries (Smith
et al. 2005; http://www.hdscience.com). Consequently, the second level of analysis is the measurement of relative or absolute amounts of the detected
components based respectively on spectra integration
or calibration curves of internal standard. A compromise between speed, selectivity and sensitivity should
be found between all these methods to select the most
suitable approach, although a combination of two or
more of them is also used to provide complementary
information and to reduce sample complexity. For
example, LC/MS with atmospheric pressure ionization (API) is also applied to metabolomics study, but
only a relatively small number of analytes can be
detected. Specifically, the production of pseudomolecular ions ([M ? H]? or [M - H]-) depends on
several factors and it is not always easy to predict

123

which one will be produced. In addition, many compounds do not ionize optimally and for this reason LC/
MS is more suited for metabolites which ionize similarly under the same condition. A rapid and non-destructive technique is the FT-IR, based on the
stretching and bending vibration of chemical bonds
irradiated by the light (usually 4000–400 cm-1).
Although it does not require a complex sample
preparation, its sensitivity is not as high as that of the
other techniques. However, in the last few years,
several studies have been undertaken using FT-IR to
diagnose disease or dysfunction and to acquire metabolic profiling of body fluids (Lemes et al. 2016; Isogawa et al. 2014). On the contrary, in other research
fields, such as plant science and food chemistry,
metabolomics studies by NMR and MS have been
mostly applied. This review assesses the limitations
and advantages of NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in metabolomics
analyses, providing a description of these analytical
techniques and their application to the metabolite
profiling of Salvia species.

NMR based metabolomics
In detail, NMR spectroscopy is a physical measurement of the resonances of atoms with a non-zero
magnetic moment, such as 1H, 13C, 15N, 19F, 31P in a
strong magnetic field. The application of a magnetic
field on the nuclei of these atoms causes the promotion
of electrons from low-energy to high-energy spin
states and the subsequent emission of radiation during
the relaxation process. It is a non-destructive technique with high reproducibility in which compounds
and extracts have a highly specific spectrum. Its
sensitivity can be improved by the application of high
and uniform magnetic fields (frequencies commonly
used range between 300 and 700 MHz). The sensitivity of NMR also depends on the abundance of isotope
studied and time of analysis. The most sensitive
isotopes are 1H, 19F and 31P, but the last two nuclei can
only be found in a restricted number of compounds.
For this reason, 1H is the preferred nuclei for
metabolites fingerprinting studies. The only variables
are the solvents used which depend on the polarity of
the extract analysed. In the 1H NMR sample there is
always much more solvent than substance, so deuterated solvents, such as D2O, CD3OD and CDCl3, are

Phytochem Rev (2018) 17:951–972

used to minimize the solvent signal in the spectra.
During the spectrum acquisition, pH and temperature
must be controlled to avoid shifts of the proton signals.
Normally, the temperature is set on the spectrometer
before the start of sample acquisition, while pH is kept
constant by the use of a buffering agent, such as
KH2PO4, and sodium deuteroxide. The chemical shifts
in 1H NMR spectra (0–10 ppm) are assigned to a
specific metabolite. The major limitation of the NMR
spectroscopy is the low sensitivity. Therefore, larger
amounts of sample are required for NMR analyses
than those required for other techniques. However, the
introduction of the new analytical instrumentations,
such as the use of microprobe and cryoprobe,
improves the detection of signals that are not normally
detected with a conventional probehead. In the first
case, using a 1 mm microprobe it is possible to analyse
very small quantities of a sample diluted in 10 ll
rather than 500 ll (5 mm) to get a better quality of the
spectra. Whereas, in the second case the probehead is
cooled down to 20 K with a cryogen (liquid helium) to
increase the signal to noise ratio.
The signals can be reported along two frequency
axes to produce a two-dimensional spectrum (2D)
which can be either homonuclear, if the correlation
comes from the same nucleus (usually 1H–1H), or
heteronuclear if on the frequency axes there are two
different nuclei (usually 1H–13C). The 2D-NMR
experiments are very useful in the case of an extensive
signal overlap in some regions of the proton spectra,
such as sugar region.
After spectra acquisition and compounds identification with pure standard and data from literature, the
quantification is performed. Usually, DSS (dimethyl4-silapentane sodium sulfonate) and TMS (tetramethylsilane) are used both as reference for the calibration of NMR shifts (resonating at 0.00 ppm) and as
internal standard, for aqueous and organic fractions,
respectively.
The integrated area under the peaks is calculated
and compared to the peak intensity of the internal
standard. Certain regions of the spectrum, such as
those containing solvent signals, are typically
excluded from the binning process.
Once completed the identification and quantification analyses, the statistical analyses can be applied to
interpret the huge amount of data.

955

MS based metabolomics
A more sensitive tool is GC–MS, which is widely
applied in metabolomics because of its high specificity
and sensitivity for suitable analyte classes. This
technique, similarly to LC/MS, is based on the
separation and detection of ions, according to their
mass–charge (m/z) ratio. A limitation of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is that
not all injected components will pass through the
column, because of different physico-chemical properties of the analytes (polarity, stability, molecular
mass, volatility, etc.). Several components therefore
remain in the injector or in the column, causing the
whole system to respond differently after each injection. However, this can be avoided if all samples are
derivatized at room or higher temperature before the
analysis in order to reduce their polarity. After
derivatization, the volatility and thermal stability of
the compounds are thus provided, allowing their
elution at high temperatures without decomposition.
In particular, compounds containing active hydrogens, such as –OH, –SH, –NH and –COOH should be
derivatized prior to GC–MS analysis. Derivatization
can be achieved by three general reactions, which are
alkylation, acylation and silylation (Orata 2012).
Usually, silylation is the most suitable reaction for
non-volatile compounds for GC analysis. As shown in
Fig. 3a, b, after silylation, an active hydrogen is
substituted by a silyl group. It is important to underline
that, despite derivatization, still numerous compounds
will not pass through a GC-column due to their high
molecular weight. Moreover, an oximation reaction is
recommended, prior to silylation, in polar extracts
containing sugars. It is well known that sugars like
fructose and glucose have different chemical structures in water solution with the predominance of cyclic
forms. To reduce the tautomerism, which can produce
multiple peaks for the same compound on the chromatogram, the oximation is required (Shepherd et al.
2007) thus converting the carbonyl groups of aldehydes and ketones into oximes (see the reaction in
Fig. 3c, d). There are several oximation and silylation
reagents which can be used, but recent studies have
shown that methoxyamine hydrochloride and Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide are the
most appropriate for metabolomics studies (Dettmer
et al. 2007; Ruiz-Matute et al. 2011).

These reactions are moisture sensitive therefore the
sample must be completely dried. Thus, preparing MS
samples is higher time-consuming compared to NMR,
and more likely to generate unrepresentative samples.
On the other hand, one of the most important
advantage of using GC–MS compared to NMR is the
very small amount of derivatised samples necessary
for the analysis (typical injection volumes of 1 ll) to
give high resolution spectra.

over the world for their nutritional properties and their
beneficial effects on human health. Qualitative and
quantitative differences described for the metabolites
profile of the same genotype could be attributed to
different technical issues, such as harvesting season,
extraction methods, environmental factors, including
altitude, climate and rainfall, abiotic or salt stress, and
nutrient availability. Qualitative analysis by NMR
spectroscopy has been obtained by 2D experiments,
comparison of chemical shifts with standard compounds and with data reported in the literature. In
Table 1 the typical identification peaks of the major
metabolites from Salvia are listed. Peak integration
and use of internal standards allowed respectively the
relative and absolute quantification. Regarding MS
identification, qualitative data were obtained by comparison with retention times and m/z values of

Salvia species
The genus Salvia consists of ca 900 species (Ayerza

word ‘‘salvere’’, referring to the curative properties of
this plant. Nowadays, some species are still used all

and absolute quantification to determine the metabolite profile of Salvia.
Salvia hispanica
Salvia hispanica L., also known as Chia, is a medicinal
and dietary plant species used since ancient times by
Mayan and Aztec. In the last years, researches have
focused their attention especially on Chia dry indehiscent fruits, which are commonly called seeds
(Bochicchio et al. 2015; Capitani et al. 2016; Jamboonsri et al. 2012). Chia seeds possess a very
important role as functional food because of their
chemical composition (de Falco et al. 2017a). Seeds
are composed by total dietary fiber, contain up to 40%
of oil with high content of unsaturated fatty acids, of
which a-linolenic acid is the most abundant one
(Ayerza and Coates 2005). Moreover, they are a good
source of proteins, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants
(de Falco et al. 2017a). There are very few scientific
papers about metabolomics studies of Chia. In the
most recent one, the metabolite profile of seven Chia
(S. hispanica L.) seeds populations, three commercial
(two black, and one white) and four early flowering
genotypes (G3, G8, G17, W13.1, three black and one
white, respectively), was investigated by NMR spectroscopy (de Falco et al. 2017b). The chemical
composition of the different genotypes was investigated both from qualitative and quantitative point of
view, through the identification of major metabolites
by 1H NMR analyses and the integration of NMR
spectra followed by chemometrics tool. The research
aimed at evaluating also the effect of agronomic
management, such as fertilization with mineral nitrogen, on the metabolite composition of the commercial
genotype. Several organic acids, free amino acids,
carbohydrates, fatty acids and phenols were identified
(Table 2) and results showed that apolar organic
extracts were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The principal component analyses (PCA) plot separated the samples showing
significant differences for signals related to carbohydrates, which were overall most abundant in commercial black genotype, while the analysis of seeds,
cultivated at different nitrogen supply, showed a
decrease in the content of carbohydrates and

123

flavonoids, and an increase of aliphatic amino acids.
The obtained data demonstrated that the 1H NMR
spectroscopy, followed by multivariate data analysis,
can provide a detailed metabolite profile of biological
samples, defining the main classes of organic compounds and selecting the best sample for food
companies based on its nutraceuticals content. Amato
et al. (2015) studied the metabolite profile of Chia
leaves fertilized and not fertilized by using HPLC–
ESI–MS. More recently de Falco et al. (2018a)
investigated the yield and metabolic profile of the
seeds of two chia populations, one commercial black
(B) and one long-day flowering genotype (G8), in
response to two irrigation levels. The analysis was
performed by ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) of
seeds followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Differences in fatty acids
and the major classes of organic compounds have been
observed due to both genotype and irrigation, especially in the non-polar phase where irrigated samples
showed a higher content of a-linolenic and other fatty
acids and a lower oleic/linoleic ratio. Another recent
study by de Falco et al. (2018b) analyzed for the first
time the Chia metabolomics in response to mutation
by the same technical approach. Mutants showed
higher seed yield than commercial seeds and mutation
affects chemical composition increasing nutraceutical
properties. These results showed that metabolomics
untargeted analysis is a very powerful methods to
evaluate mutation but also to verify the effect of
agronomic management such as fertilization and
irrigation.
Salvia miltiorrhiza
S. miltiorrhiza Bunge, also known as red sage or
Danshen, is a traditional Chinese medicinal herb used
in the treatments of cardiovascular and liver diseases
due to its antioxidant properties (Chen et al. 2000;
Sugiyama et al. 2002; Wasser et al. 1998; Zhang et al.
1990). In particular, its dry roots are widely used in
phytomedicine for the treatments of several diseases,
such as atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia and
hepatic fibrosis, due to specific metabolites including
salvianolic acids and the diterpenoids named tanshinones (Sieveking et al. 2005; Sugiyama et al. 2002).
For example, tanshinones have been reported to
possess antimicrobial activities against plant pathogens (Zhao et al. 2011), while tanshinone IIA exerts

*Range metabolite contents in S. hispanica extracts from different genotypes

vasorelaxative, antiarrhythmic and anti-cancer activities (Gao et al. 2008; Gong et al. 2010; Sun et al.
2008). Primary metabolites such as carbohydrates,
amino acids and organic acids are essential for plant
growth and maintenance of cells. However, liquid
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) methods are more suitable for secondary
metabolites such as polyphenolic acids and diterpenoids. To establish a method for detecting in a onestep procedure both primary and secondary metabolites in S. miltiorrhiza, Jiang et al. (2014) used 1HNMR fingerprint coupled with sparse partial-leastsquares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA). Metabolites
were quantified and their levels evaluated by Kruskal–
Wallis tests. In this study, S. miltiorrhiza root extracts
were collected from four different regions of China

123

(Zhongjiang, Linqu, Bozhou and Anguo). Twenty-six
primary and secondary metabolites were identified
and metabolomics studies suggest that malonate and
succinate can be possibly recognised as the key
markers for discriminating the geographical origin of
S. miltiorrhiza roots. Dai et al. (2010a) analyzed the
metabolite compositions of three cultivars of S.
miltiorrhiza Bunge roots and a cultivar obtained from
four different growing locations using NMR coupled
to LC–DAD–MS methods to assess the effectiveness
of these combined approaches in plant metabolomics.
They also acquired 1H–1H COSY, 1H–1H TOCSY, 1H
J-resolved, 1H–13C HSQC and 1H–13C HMBC 2D
NMR spectra on selected samples for resonance
assignment purposes. The results showed that the
metabolome was dominated by 4 polyphenolic acids

including salvianolic acid B, lithospermic acid, rosmarinic acid and danshensu along with 28 primary
metabolites including 5 sugars, 8 carboxylic acids, 10
amino acids and choline, while N-acetylglutamate,
aspartate and fumarate were detected for the first time
in this plant (Table 3). Moreover, their finding showed
differences for samples from different locations and
between three ecotypes in both NMR and LC–MS
spectra. These results indicated that a combined
approach of NMR and LC–MS provides different
but complementary information. In particular, NMR
methods were effective to quantitatively detect both
primary and secondary metabolites, whereas LC–
DAD–MS methods were excellent for the detection of
minor secondary metabolites. They demonstrated that
these combined methods provide an excellent
approach for targeted analysis of plant secondary
metabolite compositions associated with growing
environments and ecotypic cultivars. In another paper,
Dai et al. (2010b) demonstrated by using the same
combined methods how the metabolite profile of
S.miltiorrhiza roots changes with water depletion,
different drying processes, and different extraction
solvents. The fresh roots were subjected to freezedrying after snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, sun-drying
and air-drying, while to investigate the effects of
extraction solvents on the salvia roots metabolites, the
same dried raw materials were extracted ultrasonically
with boiling water (solvent A), 50% aqueous ethanol
(solvent B), 50% aqueous methanol (solvent C) and
chloroform–methanol mixture (3:1, v/v) (solvent D),
respectively. The PCA scores plot of NMR data
showed that, compared with extracts from solvent A,B
and C, chloroform–methanol extracts contained high
amounts of the diterpenoids tanshinone I, 15,16dihydrotanshinone I, 1,2-dihydrotanshinone I and
cryptotanshinone but less amounts of sugars, amino
acids and salvianolic acid B. Furthermore, the raffinose levels increased during the sun-drying process
but decreased during the air-drying process. The sundried samples contained significant lower levels of
polyphenolic acids (e.g., rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B) and tanshinones than the air-dried
ones. These findings strongly suggest the importance
of metabolisms in plant adaptation to osmotic stress.
Zhao et al. (2016) also studied the metabolite composition of different genotypes of S. miltiorrhiza roots,
growing in different geographical area of China
(Zhuyang, Changqing and Taian). They demonstrated

123

Phytochem Rev (2018) 17:951–972

that LC/MS-based metabolomics is a holistic and
effective method to monitor variations of the bioactive
compounds, showing how the contents of phenolic
acids and tanshinones were affected by locations as
well as genotypes. Specifically, genotypes grown in
Zhuyang as compared to those grown in Changqing
and Taian had higher phenolic acids and tanshinones
content (Table 3). Another work on S. miltiorrhiza
roots was conducted by Cui et al. (2015) who reported
the characterization of the enzymatic families in
tanshinone production in roots versus aerial tissues.
Investigation of gene structure, positive selection,
molecular docking, and mutational analysis were
performed to clarify the functional diversity of diterpene synthases, which play a very important role in
diterpenoid biosynthesis. Moreover, they provide a
metabolomics approach with two independent analytical methods for the detection of all metabolites of two
extracts: UHPLC–qTOF–MS and GC–QqQ–MS analysis for methanol and hexane extracts, respectively
(Cui et al. 2015). GC–QqQ–MS analysis was used for
the identification of metabolites not detectable with
the UHPLC–qTOF–MS method, because of their
hydrophobicity (Table 3). The UHPLC–ESI–qTOF–
MS methods revealing 39 metabolites, while GC–EI–
QqQ–MS 19. After identification and quantification,
statistical analyses were performed with PLS-DA.
Salvia officinalis
S. officinalis is traditionally used as culinary herb, in
beverages, as herbal product in the form of herbal teas,
or extracts, in cosmetics and perfumery. Its composition and biological activities have been the subject of
previous reports (Baricevic and Bartol 2000; El-Feky
and Aboulthana 2016). In particular, this plant is rich
in essential oils, with main constituents a- and bthujone, camphor, 1,8-cineole and borneol. (Baydar
et al. 2013; Seidler-Lozykowska et al. 2015). S.
officinalis is also rich in polyphenolic compounds,
including rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, carnosol,
chlorogenic and salvianolic acids (Tounekti and
Munné-Bosch 2012; El-Feky and Aboulthana 2016).
Sarrou et al. (2017) established a reliable tools to
characterize the genomic and metabolic diversity in S.
officinalis leaves grown in Greece. Based on the
difference at the genomic level and in metabolic
fingerprints, they used as selecting criteria the high
polyphenol content and the essential oil composition

in the diversification of several populations of S.
officinalis. Metabolomics analyses of hydrophilic
extract were performed with a targeted UPLC–MS/
MS method, while the essential oil contents were
identified using GC–MS. They found rosmarinic acid,
carnosol, syringic acid, caffeic acid, hesperidin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and quercetin-3-Ogalactoside as well as carnosic acid as the main

compounds and their concentration varied significantly (Table 4) among the seven genotypes. These
finding shows the efficiency of metabolite profiling
using LC–MS/MS and GC–MS to characterize the
quality of medicinal and aromatic plants. Metabolomics approach is very useful not only to study the same
genotype with several treatments but also to select and
characterize extracts from different plants. For example, Brahmi et al. (2015) compared the hydroalcoholic

123

970

extracts of eleven Algerian medicinal plants (Aloysia
triphylla, Apium graveolens, Coriandrum sativum,
Laurus nobilis, Lavandula officinalis, Marrubium
vulgare, Mentha spicata, Inula viscosa, Petroselinum
crispum, Salvia officinalis, and Thymus vulgaris)
through 1H NMR spectroscopy. Whereas, Mattoli
et al. (2006) determined the metabolic profile of eight
different plants (Cimicifuga racemosa, Filipendula
vulgaris, Helichrysum italicum, Spiraea ulmaria,
Filipendula ulmaria, Salvia officinalis, Helianthus
annuus, Achillea millefolium) obtained through ESI–
MS and NMR spectroscopy. They found that the
positive ion ESI spectra of the extracts were highly
complicated in all cases, in contrast, the negative ion
ESI mass spectra were much better defined. In the
PCA plot different samples of the same species appear
well clustered and separated from the other species,
while the aromatic region of NMR spectra were less
useful for the detection of clusters among the different
species. For this reason, they selected the ESI–MS
method, particularly with negative ion mode, as
reliable metabolomics fingerprint for a group of plants.

Other species
The untargeted metabolomics approach provided
reliable and objective techniques in the chemotaxonomic evaluation of several Salvia species. For
example, Sandasi et al. (2012) compared two species
of Salvia (S. runcinata and S. stenophylla) by using
mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) and GC–MS methods. Results showed that MIRS produced better
clustering patterns compared to GC–MS. Moreover,
S. runcinata showed greater intra-species chemical
variation compared to S. stenophylla using both
methods.

Data analysis
The untargeted metabolomics data, obtained by the
identification and quantification of as many metabolites as possible, is subsequently statistically processed. Statistical approaches require replicates of
samples preparation. Usually, multivariate data analysis (MVDA) techniques are used to maximize
classification of samples. Principal components analysis (PCA), partial least square (PLS), hierarchical

123

Phytochem Rev (2018) 17:951–972

cluster analysis (HCA) and self-organizing mapping
(SOM) have been extensively employed as statistical
tools for metabolomics. PCA is a useful approach to
reduce the dimensionality of a large data set and is the
most used chemometric tool as clustering technique.
PCA describes the variance between original variables
(in this case metabolites concentrations) through a
linear combination of new variables, which are
principal components (PC), identifying how samples
are different from each other and which variables
(metabolites concentrations) contribute most to this
difference. On the contrary, PLS regression is more
used to create a prediction model in metabolomics
studies (Tarachiwin et al. 2008). In general, PLS is
used to show the information contained in two data
sets (X = predictor matrix, Y = response matrix),
while PLS discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is a classic
PLS regression where the response variables are
qualitative (Y = categories of the samples). Sparse
partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA)
allows variable selection in a one-step procedure,
improving interpretability via valuable graphical outputs (Jiang et al. 2014). HCA is also used frequently in
metabolomics and measures the distance between
rows or columns of a data matrix. This approach can
be employed with an agglomerative or a divisive
method and data are presented in a diagram known as
dendrogram. SOM is a noncluster method widely used
for genomics and transcriptomics (Abe et al. 2003;
Hirai et al. 2004), but more recently it was also applied
to monitor metabolic dynamics in rice leaves (Sato
et al. 2008).

Conclusion
This review presents the metabolomics approaches
applied to different species of Salvia. Within several
techniques, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analysis were the most employed by researchers.
For this reason, the major advantages and limitations
of these analytical tools were discussed in details. In
conclusion, mass spectrometry, particularly GC–MS,
has a detection threshold of 10-12 mol, which is more
sensitive than 1H NMR spectroscopy where a value of
10-6 mol is observed. In both analytical methods,
extraction step is required, but all classes of compounds must be derivatized in GC–MS analysis, which
takes additional time, processing, and variance in

Phytochem Rev (2018) 17:951–972

comparison to the NMR tool. Although NMR spectroscopy is a non-destructive technique, it is not the
most suitable for the identification of lipids and
volatile compounds, for which MS provides better
results. Therefore, a single analytical method will not
provide the best result for metabolomics analyses and
a combined approach, such as parallel MS and NMR
analyses on the same sample, would be an ideal way to
increase the detection of different classes of
metabolites.
