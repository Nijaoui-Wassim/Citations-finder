Abstract
Background: Model organisms are used for research because they provide a framework on which to develop and optimize
methods that facilitate and standardize analysis. Such organisms should be representative of the living beings for which
they are to serve as proxy. However, in practice, a model organism is often selected ad hoc, and without considering its
representativeness, because a systematic and rational method to include this consideration in the selection process is still
lacking.
Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we propose such a method and apply it in a pilot study of strengths and
limitations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The method relies on the functional classification of proteins
into different biological pathways and processes and on full proteome comparisons between the putative model organism
and other organisms for which we would like to extrapolate results. Here we compare S. cerevisiae to 704 other organisms
from various phyla. For each organism, our results identify the pathways and processes for which S. cerevisiae is predicted to
be a good model to extrapolate from. We find that animals in general and Homo sapiens in particular are some of the nonfungal organisms for which S. cerevisiae is likely to be a good model in which to study a significant fraction of common
biological processes. We validate our approach by correctly predicting which organisms are phenotypically more distant
from S. cerevisiae with respect to several different biological processes.
Conclusions/Significance: The method we propose could be used to choose appropriate substitute model organisms for
the study of biological processes in other species that are harder to study. For example, one could identify appropriate
models to study either pathologies in humans or specific biological processes in species with a long development time,
such as plants.

Such a choice should be informed by several considerations. First,
the processes of interest for comparison must be clearly identified.
Then, one should establish a qualitative or quantitative metric that
measures similarity between the different organisms with respect to
those processes. Finally, the processes of interest should be
sufficiently well characterized in the alternative organisms so that
the metric can be used for comparison. If rigorously performed, this
final step defeats the purpose of using the model system as a tool to
extrapolate from, because all organism would be rigorously
characterized beforehand. In fact, this characterization (by proxy)
is the purpose of using a model organism. Therefore, methods that
rationally predict how similar different organisms might be with
respect to biological processes of interest are needed.
The accumulation of fully sequenced genomes [8] and the
advances in comparative genomics [9,10] and computational
systems biology [11] allows us to develop such methods. This can
be done by applying strategies that compare the protein or gene
networks involved in the process of interest in order to establish a

Introduction
The use of model organisms for research is a hallmark of
scientific endeavor (e.g. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]). Such organisms are used
because a) they may help overcomes ethical and experimental
constraints that hold for the target life form, b) they provide a
framework on which to develop and optimize analytical methods
that facilitate and standardize analysis, and c) they are thought to
be representative of a larger class of living beings for whatever
biological phenomenon or process the community is interested in.
However, the choice of a model organism is often guided more by
the first two considerations than by the last one. Nevertheless,
selection of a model organism based on accumulated technical
experience and on availability of experimental techniques does not
guarantee representative results in other organisms. In fact, a gap
exists in systematically establishing how close different organisms
are with respect to a given process, before choosing one of them as
a model for studying that process.

similarity ranking that can be used to predict, to a first
approximation, the accuracy of extrapolating the behavior of
specific processes between organisms. Testing this idea requires a
thorough analysis of the molecular circuits in a well-known model
organism and a comparison of these circuits to those in other living
beings.
To do this we have choose the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.
cerevisiae) to perform a pilot study. This yeast is one of the most
widely used eukaryotic model organisms. It has been used as a
model to study aging [12], regulation of gene expression [13],
signal transduction [14], cell cycle [15], metabolism [16,17],
apoptosis [18], neurodegenerative disorders [19], and many other
biological processes. For example, up to 30% of genes implicated
in human disease may have orthologs in the yeast proteome [20].
We use the protein networks that are involved in specific
biological processes to compare the differences between S. cerevisiae
and 704 other organisms, and predict in which organisms the
different processes should behave more similarly to the corresponding process in the yeast. We validate some of the predictions
by comparing the dynamic behavior of a number of specific
pathways in different organisms to that of the corresponding
pathway in S. cerevisiae.
Our results suggest that the method proposed here is adequate
for its purpose. Furthermore, they support the use of S. cerevisiae as
a model organism to study different processes, while pinpointing
specific biological phenomena from this yeast that may not be
readily comparable to their analogous processes in other
organisms. The method we propose here could be especially
relevant to assist in the choice of appropriate model organisms for
both, the study of human specific biological processes and the
characterization of a specific biological phenomenon in a large
class of organisms. It could also be useful in choosing appropriate
models for processes in organisms, such as plants, that due to their
long duplication times cannot be easily studied.

function to each of the proteins in S. cerevisiae, according to the
information derived from GO and KEGG. This allowed us to
create a functional classification of the proteins with respect to the
biological processes that they are involved in. Details about this
classification are given in Figure S1 and Tables S1–S3 materials.
With the functional classification of proteins in place, we can
compare the different molecular circuits and processes of yeast to
their analogs in 704 other organisms.
To compare these molecular circuits and biological processes
between S. cerevisiae and other organisms, we created clusters of
orthologs (ScCOGs: S. cerevisiae Clusters of Orthologs), homologues (ScCHGs: S. cerevisiae Clusters of Homologues) and
absent proteins (ScCAGs: S. cerevisiae Clusters of Absent Genes)
for each S. cerevisiae protein with respect to the translated genome
of each of the other 704 organisms. Hereafter we only discuss the
results for ScCOGs, because these are consistent with those for
ScCHGs. The results for each organism are summarized in Table
S1. The detailed clusters are provided as Text S1 and Text S2. We
are also preparing a server where these results can be further
explored and the method can be applied to other organisms.
Each cluster was associated with the functional terms corresponding to its S. cerevisiae protein. To analyze the differences
between S. cerevisiae and a specific organism with respect to a given
process, we compare the fraction of proteins that are annotated as
functioning in that process in both organisms. We investigate if
orthologs or homologues for each of these proteins are
simultaneously present in both organisms or not. Then, we rank
organisms with respect to the differences in the set of proteins
responsible for each process, analyzing for ScCOGs, ScCHGs and
ScCAGs at the level of domain, kingdom and phyla for all the 704
organisms (summarized in Tables S2 and S3).

Functional comparison of the full S. cerevisiae protein
complement to that of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes
We compared how well the proteins in the different ScCOGs,
ScCHGs and ScCAGs are conserved between S. cerevisiae and
various classes of organisms. This allowed us to predict if S.
cerevisiae can be a good model for specific processes in different
classes of organisms, rather than in individual species. The details
of the analysis are presented in appendix S1. No S. cerevisiae protein
has orthologs in all 704 organisms. Furthermore, no S. cerevisiae
protein has homologues in all the Prokaryotes (Archaea & Bacteria
together). In addition, 2642 (45%) S. cerevisiae proteins are absent in
all the Prokaryotes (for more details see Tables S2 and S3).

Results
Strategy for the comparison of different processes in
different organisms
The strategy we use to establish how similar a given process is in
two different organisms is as follows. First, we identify orthologs
(i.e. genes in different species that evolved from a common
ancestral gene by speciation) between the genome of the potential
model organism and that of the target organism(s). Then, we
attribute function to the different genes in the organisms under
comparison and assign each gene to specific biological processes,
using biological ontologies [21]. Specifically, we use:
a)

b)

ARCHAEA DOMAIN
We analyzed 48 species of Archaea. About 20% (1158) of all S.
cerevisiae proteins generate ScCOGs that contain Archaea sequences.
However, only 2% (103) of all yeast proteins generate ScCOGs
that contain at least a sequence from each sequenced species of
Archaea. An additional 18 (0.3%) S. cerevisiae proteins have
homologues in all Archaea. 3672 (62%) S. cerevisiae proteins are
absent in all Archaea. Most of these have unknown function.
Overall, there is no group of organisms for which the networks of
proteins responsible for a large fraction of biological processes in S.
cerevisiae are similar to their counterparts in Archaea. However, some
biological processes are predicted to be similar between S. cerevisae
and some Archaea (see below).

The Gene Ontology (GO) [22], which has been widely used
for annotating function and localization of genes at a coarse
level in many organisms [23,24,25,26,27], and
The pathways that regulate and execute the processes that
one is interested in studying, as defined in KEGG [28] (one
can also use MetaCYC [29]).

Finally, we compare the sets of genes responsible for the
different processes that are present in each organism. Such an
approach predicts if two organisms are likely to be comparable
with respect to specific processes of interest, by establishing
whether the elements that are a part of the molecular circuits
executing the relevant processes are analogous between the
organisms (see methods for further details).
Because this is a pilot study, we focus on an organism that is
widely used and well characterized, S. cerevisiae. We have attributed

neogenesis’’, ‘‘methane metabolism’’, ‘‘Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis’’ and ‘‘Aminoacyl-t-RNA biosynthesis’’ are pathways that
appear to be similar to those of S. cerevisiae in a large fraction of
organisms. Pathways such as S. cerevisiae’s ‘‘RNA polymerase’’ (29
genes), ‘‘Lysosome’’ (14 genes), ‘‘Endocytosis’’ (33 genes), ‘‘Oxidative phosphorylation’’ (76 genes), ‘‘Ribosome’’ (142 genes),
‘‘MAPK signaling pathway - yeast’’ (55 genes), ‘‘DNA replication’’
(30 genes), and ‘‘Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis’’ (44 genes) and
‘‘Nucleotide excision repair’’ (34 genes) are much more similar to
those from other eukaryotes than to the corresponding prokaryotic
pathways (when they exist). Among the pathways that are central
for life, the one that appears to be more unique to S. cerevisiae and
other Saccharomycetes is cell cycle (115 genes), because only a
small fraction of its proteins have orthologs in other eukaryotes.
Thus, these results suggest that extrapolating cell cycle studies in S.
cerevisiae to other organisms outside of the Saccharomycetes clade
should be done only at the level of basic principles, if at all (see for
example [30,31]). A more detailed analysis of these pathways and
their similarity between S. cerevisiae and the other 704 organisms
can be found in the appendix and in Figure S2.
An encouraging observation for the use of S. cerevisiae as a model
organism for mammals is that most of the studied mammals
(humans, dogs, mice, cows and rats) are among the non-fungal
organisms that have biological processes with protein sets that are
similar to the corresponding sets of S. cerevisiae. Specifically, the sets
of S. cerevisiae proteins that are associated to ‘‘Mismatch repair’’ (18
genes), ‘‘Ubiquitin and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis’’ (5
genes), ‘‘Inositol phosphate metabolism’’ (15 genes), ‘‘Steroid
biosynthesis’’ (15 genes), ‘‘Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis’’ (44
genes), ‘‘DNA replication’’ (30 genes), ‘‘Ribosome’’ (142 genes),
‘‘Proteasome’’ (35 genes), ‘‘Mismatch repair’’ (18 genes), ‘‘Galactose metabolism’’ (23 genes), ‘‘One carbon pool by folate’’ (14
genes) and ‘‘Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis’’ (48 genes) are those that
appear to be more similar to the corresponding sets of proteins in
man. A more thorough analysis is given in the Appendix S1.

bacterial species. Furthermore, 2881 (49%) S. cerevisiae genes are
absent from all Bacteria, a smaller percentage than that for Archaea.
As was the case in archaea, overall, there is no group of organisms
for which the networks of proteins responsible for a large fraction
of biological processes in S. cerevisiae are similar to their
counterparts in Bacteria. However, some biological processes are
predicted to be similar between S. cerevisae and some Bacteria (see
below).

EUKARYOTA DOMAIN
Overall, there are 59 species of Eukaryotes in our dataset. About
4.5% (263) of all ScCOGs contain sequences from each of these
organisms. Between 40% and 60% of all S. cerevisiae proteins
involved in ‘‘MAPK signaling pathways’’, ‘‘Signal transduction’’
biological process, and ‘‘Helicase activity’’ molecular functions
have orthologs in all 59 species. Furthermore, between 60% and
80% of all proteins involved in ‘‘Microtubule organizing center’’ of
S. cerevisiae are also found in all 59 sequenced eukaryotes. Overall,
the networks of proteins responsible for a large fraction of
biological processes in S. cerevisiae are similar to their counterparts
in ascomycetes. Furthermore, several biological processes are
predicted to be similar between S. cerevisae and other Eukaryotes.
A more detailed analysis of the three domains is given in
Appendix S1.

Functional comparison of biological processes and
pathways between S. cerevisiae and other organisms
After getting such a bird’s eye view of the similarities and
differences between S. cerevisiae and different clades of organisms
with respect to different biological processes, we now focus on
individual organisms. To obtain an approximate estimation of how
close a given biological process is between S. cerevisiae and another
organism we build a matrix of 70465880 entries. In this matrix, a
row represents an organism, while a column represents a ScCOG.
The matrix entries are 0 if no sequence from the corresponding
organism is found in the appropriate ScCOG and 1 otherwise.
Then, we build a secondary set of four additional matrices
containing information about KEGG pathways, biological processes,
molecular activity and cellular localization. In each matrix, the rows
represent the organisms and the columns represent the biological
process, the cellular localization, the molecular function, or the
KEGG pathway. Each entry in one of these matrices is a vector with
a variable number of elements that is constant for each column of a
matrix. The number of elements in the vector is equal to the number
of different proteins that is associated to the specific biological process
or pathway corresponding to the column (See methods for details).
Subsequently, we calculate the Normalized Hamming Distance
(NHD) between the vector of proteins in one entry of the matrix and
the corresponding vector for S. cerevisiae from that same column.
This NHD is a metric based on the number of elements that are
different between the two vectors. The smaller the NHD, the more
similar the two vectors are and the more similar the set of proteins
executing a specific process in both organisms is. Consequently, the
more likely it is that S. cerevisiae is a good model to study the relevant
process and generalize the results to the other organism. Using this
metric we have clustered the organisms in the matrix according to
growing overall NHD with respect to S. cerevisiae.

GO Biological Processes, Cellular Component and
Molecular Function
Figures 2 and 3 summarize the results for the comparisons
between S. cerevisiae and the other organisms using the GO
categories classification. Details can be further analyzed in Figures
S3, S4 and S5. The results are similar to those described for
Figure 1 (or those reported in Figure S2), which suggests that these
functional classifications are, to a large extent, equivalent, in spite
of all problems that they might have (see discussion). S. cerevisiae
metabolic activities like ‘‘Cellular amino acid and derivative
metabolic process’’, ‘‘Cellular aromatic compound metabolic
process’’, ‘‘Heterocycle metabolic process’’, ‘‘Cofactor metabolic
process’’ and ‘‘Vitamin metabolic process’’ are the ones that are
more conserved in all organisms. In contrast, ‘‘cytoskeleton
organization’’, ‘‘Transcription’’, ‘‘Anatomical structure morphogenesis’’, ‘‘Transposition’’, ‘‘conjugation’’, ‘‘Cell budding’’, and
‘‘Protein modification process’’ appear to be conserved mostly in
eukaryotes. Conservation of the ‘‘Cell wall organization’’ pathway
is restricted to fungi.

Validating the predictions
The analysis described above and the results given in Figures 1,
2 and 3 and in Figures S2-S5 ranks the difference between the
protein set responsible for a given biological process in each
organism and the corresponding set in S. cerevisiae. If our earlier
arguments are correct, one would expect that the similarity
between the adaptive responses that involve a given process in
other organisms and the same responses in S. cerevisiae is directly

and execute that process.
In other words, we define a static metric of closeness of processes
between organisms that is based solely on the similarity between the
sets of proteins involved in those processes in both organisms. Can
we assume that such a metric is also a good measure of closeness
between physiological and adaptive responses of the pathways
regulating the processes in the organisms being compared, even
though it does not include any kinetic or regulatory information?

based on a careful analysis of Figure S3. We systematically identified
pathways or processes with more than 4 genes and then searched
the literature for comparable studies of the dynamical and adaptive
behavior of these processes in different organisms that belong to our
dataset. We were able to identify twelve cases that could be used to
answer the question from the previous paragraph.
The results are summarized in Table S4. They show that the
phenotypic adaptations and dynamical behavior of a given
pathway is more similar to that of S. cerevisiae in organisms that

another organism?’’ We propose a systematic way to answer this
question that involves comparing the similarity between the set of
proteins that participate in the biological process of interest in the
organism to the equivalent set of proteins in the organism to which
we want to extrapolate the results. The closer the set of proteins is
between the two, the more likely it is that the results from one
organism can be extrapolated to the other.To compare the sets of
proteins between organisms, we propose a procedure that involves:
a) associating a protein to a process or pathway, for example using
GO categories or the KEGG pathways, and b) compare the sets of
proteins associated to the process between the relevant organisms.
This method offers a proxy for establishing probable equivalency
of processes between organisms, but it has some drawbacks.

limitations

may find a situation where two organisms are predicted as being
good models with respect to a given process when the proteins in
one organism are a small subset of those in the other.
Second, using sequence similarity to establish functional
orthology also has its drawbacks. On one hand, sometimes
functional orthology exists even in the absence of sequence
orthology and vice versa. Comparing the structures of proteins as
well as their amino acid motifs and active centers provides some
assistance in tackling this problem. However, at the current stage
of development in bioinformatics, sequence comparison is still the
most efficient and accurate way to make such predictions on the
scale that we made them for this work. On the other hand,
sometimes, due to gene duplication and domain shuffling, proteins
that are unique in one organism may have several close sequence
homologues in another. We address this problem by proposing a
procedure that takes several similarity factors between sequences

First, more often than not, there will be little functional
information associated to the proteins of a given organism. To
overcome such a problem, we propose choosing an initial subject
organism that is well studied and functionally well characterized at
the molecular level. As our method relies on ortholog identification
and functional annotation, it requires that this annotation be
continuously improved even in well studied organisms. By
choosing S. cerevisiae as an example we use the eukaryotic organism
that we believe has the best overall functional annotation. It must
also be emphasized that, when comparing the set of proteins that
participate in a given process in different organisms, one must
consider the ‘‘super set’’ of proteins participating in that process
and compare the differences. In other words, for example when
comparing KEGG pathways, one can consider the pathway that
includes all possible EC numbers and then compare the two
organisms in this context. This was also done here. Otherwise, one

unsuitable model organisms and for choosing an appropriate
model organism from which to study and extrapolate the
dynamical and adaptive behavior of specific biological processes.

into account before deciding which of the homologues is the more
likely to be orthologous to the query protein. These factors include
e-value score, similarity of the sequences and the fraction of the
two proteins that is comparable. Nevertheless, if one also analyzes
homologues separately, as we also do here, one stands a better
chance of controlling for false negative orthologs.
Third, by comparing only the set of proteins associated with a
given biological process in different organisms, we are disregarding
regulatory and dynamic information that could be important for
the comparison. This shortcoming may not be problematic. On
one hand our method is a good way to eliminate processes and
organisms for which the reference organism is not a good model. If
the sets of proteins that execute a given process are very dissimilar,
then the dynamics are not even an issue because other model
organisms need to be chosen. On the other hand, having a more
similar set of proteins associated to a specific process makes it more
likely that the adaptive and regulatory responses of the process be
similar. This claim can be supported by comparing the
physiological responses of different organisms to that of the model
organism (see below).
Fourth, sometimes the logic used to define the proteins
associated to specific biological pathways or processes is questionable. This is a very important factor and a successful general
application of the method described here requires that the
annotation of genomes and ontologies/pathways keeps on
improving. Poorly characterized biological processes will lead to
greater errors in the comparisons. There is little we can do with
respect to this limitation at this time. One of the actions that can
be taken to minimize this problem is to choose as a model an
organism that is one of the best annotated worldwide. We did so
by choosing S. cerevisiae as a model for the study. This organism has
the additional advantages of being well characterized at the
molecular level and used to study many biological processes that
are important in other organisms. To further ameliorate this
problem we carefully curated both the KEGG and GO
associations of yeast.

Conclusion
Our results support the use of S. cerevisiae as a model organism to
study different biological processes and pathways in specific
organisms, while pinpointing specific processes in this yeast that
may not be readily generalizable to other organisms. We conclude
that using a single proteome as a reference and applying a
methodology such as the one suggested here, one can in general
appropriately select model organisms to study the dynamic and
adaptive responses of a given biological process, as long as the
proteins that participate in that process are known.

Materials and Methods
Selection of genome sequences
The complete proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5880 proteins)
was downloaded from NCBI (December 2009). The complete
sequences for the full protein complement of 704 organisms with
fully sequenced genomes was downloaded from the KEGG
database (December 2009) and cross-referenced to that provided
the NCBI database.

Homology analysis
We downloaded BLAST version 2.2.18 from NCBI and used it
locally. All genome and protein sequences were formatted using
FormatDB. A pipeline for selecting orthologous proteins, homologous proteins and proteins of the S. cerevisiae that are absent in
each of the other organisms was developed and implemented in
PERL.

Orthology analysis
The collection of all proteins in a target genome that blasted
against a specific protein of S. cerevisiae with an e-value #10210 was
analyzed. Manually and through the comparison of the S. cerevisiae
proteome to that of two organisms from each class, we setup a
cutoff value for separating orthologs from homologues. Pairs of
proteins with e-value between 10210 and 10236 and identity score
below 30% are considered as homologues. If the alignment spans
over 85% of either sequence and either the e-value of the blast
search is bellow 10236 or the identity score is higher than 30%,
both proteins are considered as belonging to the same family of
orthologs [35]. When more than one protein in a target genome
meets these conditions with respect to the same S. cerevisiae protein
we calculate an orthology score function, F. The protein with the
highest F-score function is considered to be the most likely
ortholog with respect to the S. cerevisiae protein, while the
remaining proteins are flagged as in-paralogs of that ortholog. F
is defined as follows:

S. cerevisiae as a model organism
We apply our method to a pilot study of S. cerevisiae as a model
organism, by comparing it to 704 other organisms. The results are
presented in detail in Figures 1, 2 and 3, Figures S1–S5 and Tables
S1–S4. In S. cerevisiae 4571 proteins are not associated to any
pathway in the KEGG database. Analyzing the approximately
1000 proteins that have such a functional association, we find that,
as expected, in many cases evolutionary closeness goes on par with
similarity between sets of proteins that are associated to a specific
biological process.
As mentioned above, our inference of closeness between S.
cerevisiae and the other organisms is based upon an analysis of
similarity between the sets of proteins involved in a specific process
in both organisms. This analysis does not include any information
about the physiological responses and the dynamic or regulatory
aspects of the biological processes and pathways being compared
between organisms. To understand if this limitation is in general
important we selected pathways for which dynamic, regulatory,
and phenotypic information was available for S. cerevisiae and for a
scope of other different organisms. We then compare the behavior
of those pathways in yeast and in the other organisms. In this
comparison, organisms that are predicted to be closer for a specific
pathway or process also have more similar adaptive responses
(Table S4). Furthermore, recent work that uses orthology between
human genes and those in other organisms to find models for
human diseases support these results [32,33,34]. Together, this
suggests that our method is adequate both for eliminating

In Eq. 3, AL represents the length of the alignment, and PL is
the total length of the query sequence. F2 is always between 0 and

the target sequence is, the more similar the two proteins will be

a high level of coincidence between the set of proteins involved in
the specific pathway (column) in a given organism (row) and the set

In Eq. 4, G1 represents the number of gaps within the aligned
region of the query sequence, L1 represents the length of the query
sequence, G2 represents the number of gaps within the aligned
region of the target sequence, and L2 represents the full length of
the target sequence. The closer to zero F3 is the more similar will
the two sequences be.
Theoretically, -‘#F#2. However, in practice, we found that F
typically assumes values between 0 and 2. The higher F is, the
more likely it is that the query and target sequence are orthologs.
The whole process is summarized in Figure 4. At the end of the
analysis we obtain clusters of orthologs (ScCOGs) and
homologues (ScCHGs) for all the S. cerevisiae genes with respect
to the other 704 organisms. We also obtain a third family of
clusters (ScCAGs), that of proteins from S. cerevisiae that are absent
from the target genomes.

(column) in a given organism (row) with respect to the same
biological process in S. cerevisiae. Intermediate colors indicate
intermediate degrees of coincidence between the set of proteins in
the target organism and that in S. cerevisiae.

Classification of clusters according to pathways and
biological processes
In order to attribute biological function to the ScCOGs,
ScCHGs and ScCAGs, we implemented the following procedure.
On one hand, we used the GOSLIM classification of gene
function for S. cerevisiae from SGD [36,37] to attribute biological
function, molecular functions and cellular localization to each
cluster. On the other, we downloaded data from KEGG that
associates genes to KEGG metabolic circuits in fully sequenced
genomes [38] and attribute pathways terms to each of the clusters.

distant each organisms is from S. cerevisiae with respect
to each molecular function from the GOSLIM classification. A green square indicates a high level of coincidence
between the set of proteins involved in the specific molecular
function (column) in a given organism (row) and the set of proteins
for the same function in S. cerevisiae. A red square indicates
complete absence of the set of proteins involved in the specific
function (column) in a given organism (row) with respect to the
same molecular function in S. cerevisiae. Intermediate colors
indicate intermediate degrees of coincidence between the set of
proteins in the target organism and that in S. cerevisiae.

Calculation of the Hamming distance
The Hamming Distance (HD) between the vector,V 1. of
protein functions associated to a specific process, localization or
pathway in S. cerevisiae and the vector, V 2. of corresponding
protein functions in another organism gives a measure of how
different the two vectors are. It is calculated using the formula
HD~,i~1{n{ð1{,d{i:Þ. where,d{i: is the Kronecker
delta, d{i: is 1 if the elements in position i of both vectors
are orthologs and 0 otherwise. The smaller the distance, the more
similar the two vectors are and the more similar is the set of genes
executing a specific process in both organisms. HD can be
normalized (NHD) by dividing it by the maximum HD between
corresponding vectors of all organisms. Consequently, the smaller
NHD is, the more likely that S. cerevisiae is a good model to study the
relevant process or pathways and generalize the results for the other
organism. The vectors we define for each pathway include all
proteins that could participate in that pathway in all organisms in
