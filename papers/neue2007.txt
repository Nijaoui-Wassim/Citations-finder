ABSTRACT
In this chapter on HPLC columns, we are discussing both the surface chemistry of
a packing as well as column design and performance. In the section that covers column
chemistry, we cover modern options of base materials as well as the commonly used
approaches towards the surface chemistry of a packing. Specific subsections are dedicated to the selectivity of reversed-phase packings, HILIC, monolithic structures, and the
reproducibility of modern packings. In the section on speed and resolution, we familiarize the reader with the principles of how to choose a column. In the section on specialty
columns, we cover briefly preparative chromatography and columns with a very small
diameter.

I. INTRODUCTION

When we consider the role of HPLC column technology, we should
remind ourselves that the birth hour of true high-performance LC was when
it became possible for the first time to pack efficient columns with particles
smaller than 30 gm. a This improved the separation performance of a standard column from a few hundred theoretical plates to a few thousand, and
quite satisfactory analyses could be performed in a time frame of around
15 min to half an hour. This performance resulted in the rapid acceptance
of HPLC in the analytical laboratories in the pharmaceutical industry.
An important element of column performance is the particle size of the
packing. However, there is much more to the story than just the particle
size. We will provide in this chapter the important aspects of column performance in chromatography. In Section II, we will familiarize the reader
first with the different options available today with respect to the particle
backbone or the structure of chromatographic columns. Then we will look
into the very important subject of the surface chemistry of chromatographic packings. What creates the selectivity of the separation? How can
this selectivity be characterized in a quantitative way? What are the characteristics of the commonly used types of chromatographic packings?
How are they useful in the practice of HPLC? Finally, we will go back to
the parameters that make HPLC what it is today: the speed and the resolving power in a separation. How can we assess both in a quantitative way?
How can we judge the overall capability of a column? Is there a difference
in the case of isocratic chromatography and gradient chromatography,
and how can we evaluate column performance under gradient conditions?
In most of these discussions, we will focus on particle-based columns.
However, today another option has become available: monolithic
columns, both based on silica and on polymeric structures. We will briefly
discuss the basic properties of these new structures as well. The most
commonly used packings are silica-based packings. Polymeric packings
have been an alternative for a long time, but their disadvantages outweighed the advantages, and they are much less frequently used for the
HPLC analysis of small molecules. However, polymer-based packings
are successfully used in sample preparation techniques. In modern times,
other alternatives to silica have been developed, and these newer alternatives have gained a wider acceptance. These include hybrid packings
and packings based on zirconia or titania.
In Section IV, we will briefly cover some aspects of unusual column
dimensions. Is there any advantage to a column with a very small diameter? What are the aspects of column design and the choice of particle
size that are important for preparative applications? This discussion will
be brief only.
Of course, all these sections do not need to be read in sequence and
stand on their own.

HPLC COLUMNS AND PACKINGS

I!. COLUMN CHEMISTRY
A. General Comments

All but few particles used in HPLC are fully porous packings.
Fully porous packings have a large specific surface area, and this creates a larger retention and a larger loadability, i.e. fully porous packings are less prone to exhibit broad peaks with increased injection
(with respect to both volume and mass). A typical specific surface
area is in the range of 200-300 m2/g. This quite sizeable surface area
resides in the pores of the packing. The pore size must be sufficiently
large to allow access of the analytes to the surface of the packing. For
the analysis of small molecules (molecular weight 100-500), a pore
size of 1 0 n m is about right. Some packings have a slightly smaller
pore size (around 8 nm), some have a bit larger pores (about 13 nm).
One needs to be careful with some of these designations though, since
the methods used for the pore size measurements are not consistent
from manufacturer to manufacturer, and often only nominal values
are given.
The 10nm (or 100 A) packings can be used for peptide analysis as well,
but for larger molecules (proteins) a larger pore size, nominally 30nm (or
300 A), is needed. The larger pore size provides a smaller specific surface
area, therefore these larger pore packings are less retentive, and they are not
commonly used for small molecules.
The most important properties of a porous particle are the specific
surface area and the specific pore volume. "Specific" means that these
values are given per gram of packing. This approach is acceptable for a
comparison of different silica-based packings, but such values can be
misleading, if silica-based packings are compared to zirconia-based
packings or polymer-based packings. Chromatographers are usually
more interested in which packing would result in more retention or less
retention. The retentivity of a particle can be estimated quickly by looking at the ratio of the specific surface area to the specific pore volume.
This is called the particle phase ratio tip:2
Asp

/~P ~---V

sp

(1)

Asp is the specific surface area (in m2/g) and Vsp is the specific pore
volume (in mL/g). However, for a quantitative assessment, the ratio of
the surface area of the packing in the column to the column void volume
needs to be considered. This true phase ratio inside the column can be
calculated as follows: 2

8i is the interstitial fraction. Its value is typically 0.4 for most HPLC
columns. The skeletal density pp is 2.2g/mL for silica. For polymeric
packings, it is around 0.8-1 g/mL. This equation allows for a meaningful comparison of different packings, including non-porous packings.
The advantage of fully porous packings is clear: they have a much
larger surface area than non-porous particles. Therefore, their retentivity
and loadability is much larger. Equation (2) permits a direct comparison
of the retentivity of all packings, whether they are non-porous, porous,
superficially porous, or based on silica or another carrier.
It is important to get a true understanding of the basic properties of
different particles to obtain a proper assessment of their value in chromatography. You will find that the true phase ratio gives you quite a different impression than the surface area alone. Let us compare two
packings! One is a silica packing with a specific surface area of 350 m2/g
and a specific pore volume of 1 mL/g; the other is also a silica packing,
but now with a specific surface area of 200 m2/g and a specific pore volume of 0.5 mL/g. When we calculate the phase ratios, we find that both
are practically identical: 178 m2/mL compared to 176 m2/mL. Thus, the
retentivity and the preparative loadability of both packings should be
equal, unless other particle properties affect these values. If we would
have used only the specific surface area for judging the retention of these
two packings, we would have believed that the one with the larger surface area would be nearly two times as retentive. This comparison points
out the importance of Equation (2).
The strength of a particle depends on its specific pore volume. For
normal HPLC applications, strength is of no issue, if the specific pore
volume is 1 mL/g or less. For ultra-high-pressure applications, a slightly
lower pore volume is needed.

B. The Particle Backbone

In HPLC, packings based on silica are predominantly utilized. The
most important reason for the broad use of silica is its mechanical
strength together with the availability of well-established surface modification techniques, especially for the creation of reversed-phase packings
(see Section II.C). Another important feature of silica is the freedom with
which surface area and pore size can be tailored to specific applications.
One needs to distinguish two types of silica. The classical type is of
low purity, and contains a fair amount of other ions in its matrix and on
its surface. Common impurities are alumina and iron oxide. Both stem
from the raw materials, which are of inorganic origin (water glass).
These contaminants are embedded in the matrix of the material, and create acidified surface silanols. Acidic surface silanols are a significant
problem when reversed-phase packings based on a classical silica are
used in applications common to the pharmaceutical industry, such as the

3

4~

analysis of compounds containing basic functional groups (amino
groups). The classical way to solve the problem is to work only under
acidic mobile-phase conditions and/or with bases as competing additives
to the mobile phase, or both.
This problem was reduced significantly when high-purity silicas
became commercially available. They are synthesized from very pure
organic silanes, such as tetraethoxysilane, and metal contamination can
be kept out of a silica based on these raw materials by using carefully
controlled manufacturing processes. There is a class difference in the
peak shape quality for basic analytes between reversed-phase packings
based on classical silicas and those based on high-purity silicas. Today,
packings based on high-purity silicas are widely available, and there are
no compromises that would prevent anyone from using these much
higher quality packings based on high-purity silicas. Since method development with high-purity or other modern packings is so much easier, we
recommend the use of modern packings for this purpose.
The surface of a silica packing (or a silica-hybrid packing, see below)
is occupied by silanols. One distinguishes three types of silanol groups.

Lone silanols are more acidic than the other types of silanols, which
exist on well-hydrated surfaces. The generally accepted average pK a of
silanols on a fully hydroxylated high-purity silica is around 7. 3 On a lowpurity silica, a significant portion of the silanols are more acidic, 4 which
is the cause of base tailing on the older silicas.
In recent years, a derivative technology of high-purity silica has been
developed: hybrid organic/inorganic packings based on a co-condensation
of tetraethoxysilane and other silanes containing silicon-carbon bonds.
This technology provides a mixed organic/inorganic matrix. The primary
advantage of this technology is an improved stability of the packing to an
alkaline environment. Silica-based packings are commonly unstable above
pH 8 even at room temperature. A dense coating with a C18 layer can alleviate this problem somewhat, but the real solution to this weakness of silica
is a modification of the matrix. The incorporation of methyl groups or
ethyl bridges into the matrix significantly improves the pH stability of the
packing. Methyl-hybrid packings have been reported to be stable above
pH 11, while the stability of a newer version, the ethyl-bridged hybrid
packing, 4 has been demonstrated to reach pH 12.

50

U.D. NEUE et al.

A side benefit of at least one version of the hybrid silicas is a shift of
the pK a of the surface silanols into the alkaline pH range, s Under the same
conditions of measurement, the pK a of a high-purity silica was measured to
be around 7, while it was around 10 for the methyl hybrid packing. 6 This
means that the "silanol activity" of the methyl hybrid packing is much
reduced compared to silica-based packings, resulting in generally improved
peak shapes for basic analytes compared even to high-purity silica packings.
Zirconia-based packings are stable from pH 1 to 14, as well as at elevated temperatures. However, bonding procedures like the silanization
of silica are not available for zirconia. For reversed-phase applications,
packings are prepared by either a coating of the zirconia with polybutadiene or polystyrene, or by preparing a thin surface layer of carbon, with
a subsequent derivatization of the carbon with a C18 layer. The zirconia
carrier has a large pore size, 30 nm, with an associated lower specific
surface area (30m2/g). The lower surface area means that commonly
10-30% less organic modifier is needed for getting equivalent retention
to a standard silica-based C18 column for a neutral analyte.
Due to the unique character of the zirconia surface, one needs to
rethink the method development process. Phosphate, bicarbonate, or
carboxylic acid buffers are preferred mobile phase additives, but they are
also strongly adsorbed to the zirconia surface. The carbon-coated zirconia is more akin to activated carbon than to a C18 packing, and it retains
some of these characteristics after the C18 coating.
Polymer-based packings are very rarely used in reversed-phase
applications for small molecules. The reason for this lack of use is, on
one hand, the commonly inferior mass transfer properties of polymeric
packings (i.e., they give wider peaks), and on the other hand, the swelling
and shrinking that goes along with an organic polymer. Polymeric
packings are more frequently used in special applications such as size
exclusion chromatography, hydrophilic interaction chromatography,
large molecular weight biomolecule analysis, or in sample preparation
techniques.
C. The Particle Surface
The particle surface is the most important part of the packing, since
it is the interaction with this surface that creates the separation. We will
once again focus on silica and silica-hybrid packings since they are most
commonly used.
I. Surface Chemistry
The surface silanols of silica are derivatized with organosilanes to create the different types of packings. 7 Typical reagents are chlorosilanes,
although other silanes can be used as well. Monofunctional, difunctional,
and trifunctional silanes can be equally employed in this surface reaction.

If a difunctional or trifunctional silane is used, more than one bond

The desired predominant reaction product of a difunctional silane
with the surface is the structure shown above. In this way, a maximum
number of surface silanols can be removed. However, the details of the
actual reaction conditions determine how close one can get to obtaining
a large concentration of bidentate bonding. For many bonded molecules,
only one link to the surface is formed, and the second silanol is left open.
Trifunctional silanes almost never form a triple link to the surface.
Thus, the derivatization with a trifunctional silane creates at least as
many new silanol groups as there are ligands attached to the surface. In
order to remove these new silanols of multi-functional silanes and residual silanols that were not accessible to the larger monofunctional silanes,
the packings are commonly endcapped with trimethylsilyl groups:

/OH3
Si~CH 3

\

OH3

This procedure removes additional accessible silanols. However, we
must keep in mind that there are about 8 l~mol/m2 of silanols on a fully
hydroxylated silica, but the surface reaction and the endcapping can only
eliminate about 4 ~tmol/m2, leaving still plenty of silanols on the surface.
These silanols tend to interact with basic analytes, and may produce peak
tailing. This is one of the reasons why hybrid packings have been created,
since they exhibit a smaller number of silanol groups on the surface to start
with. Modern, high-quality, more sophisticated endcapping techniques
can also remove a larger number of these "residual" silanol groups.
Another bonding option not yet mentioned is the use of bidentate
ligands. Such ligands have the capability to attach to the surface in more
than one spot. This results in an additional improvement in stability.

The common side group of monofunctional silanes is a methyl
group. However, added stability under acidic conditions can be achieved
with more bulky side chains, such as isopropyl or isobutyl groups. The
disadvantage of this approach is that the bulkiness of these side chains
reduces the surface coverage, and thus more silanols remain and accessible by analyte molecules.
The most common ligand in reversed-phase chromatography is the
C18 ligand, an 18-carbon hydrocarbon chain. This chain creates the
hydrophobic retention of the reversed-phase packing. As an alternative,
a C 8 ligand is sometimes used. Due to the shorter chain length, it provides a bit less retention than the C18 ligand, but it is occasionally preferred for several reasons. Sometimes, a shorter retention is desired.
Some C 8 packings give a slightly improved peak shape compared to a C18
ligand, since the smaller ligand can result in a slightly better surface coverage. Or, a slightly different selectivity is desired. It should be pointed
out that the selectivity differences between C~8 and C8 packings based on
the same substrate and with the same surface coverage are rather small,
but they still can be useful on occasion.
If one is looking for an appreciable difference in selectivity, packings
with an embedded polar group are recommended as the first choice. These
packings have a polar group incorporated into the long-chain ligand, three
carbons away from the silicon group that is used to attach the ligand to the
surface. 8 In order to be effective, the polar group is best selected from the
group of amide, carbamate, or urea, which all provide excellent hydrogen
bonding capability. The three commonly used examples are shown below.

R represents the possible side groups. For a monofunctional ligand
(such as the commercially available carbamate phase), R represents a methyl
group. Most other packings are based on a trifunctional silane, which means
that R is either an additional attachment to the surface or a free silanol.
The length of the ligand varies with the manufacturer. Some short
ligands with eight carbons are available, other packings use longer chains,
such as a C14 ligand.
Many (but not all) of the commercially available amide phases are
prepared in a two-step reaction, where the silica is first derivatized with
an amino silane, and the amide is formed in the second step. This leaves
residual amine on the surface. This gives these packings an additional
anion exchange function, which can be as detrimental to the peak shapes
of acids as silanols are for the peak shapes of bases.
Recently, another packing of the same class was introduced. It is
based on a sulfonamide function as the embedded polar group.

This phase does not appear to have the hydrogen bonding ability of
the phases mentioned above, but it improves the peak shape for difficult
analytes as the other packings with embedded polar functions do.
Finally, a combination of the idea of the bidentate ligand with the
idea of an embedded polar group has become commercially available
as well. In this case, both attachments to the surface are based on a
trifunctional silane, and the distance between "neighboring" attachment
groups is rather large:

All packings with an embedded polar group share with each other
the fact that they can be used in 100% aqueous mobile phases without
dewetting, 9 an improved peak shape for basic analytes, and significantly
different selectivity patterns compared to standard C~8 phases. These differences in the selectivity compared to the classical C18 phases can be
attributed to the participation of the polar group in the interaction of
analytes with the surface of the packing.
Another packing with an embedded polar group is based on a phenol
ether. However, this group does not exhibit the characteristic selectivity
effects typical of the amide, carbamate, and urea phases.
A comparison of the selectivity difference between different packings
is shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the retention times of over 70 analytes
measured in an acetonitrile or a methanol gradient at pH 3, 7, and 10 are
shown. In Figure l a, the retention data obtained on a C 8 packing are
compared to the same data on a C18 packing. In Figure l b, the same
comparison is made for a classical C8 column and a packing with an
embedded carbamate group of the same chain length. One can see that
the scatter is much larger for the comparison of the classical column and
the embedded-polar-group column (EPG column). This demonstrates the
larger selectivity difference created by the embedded polar group.
Figure 2 depicts the details of the selectivity difference between a classical C 8 packing and a packing with an embedded polar group. For simplicity, only the data obtained in methanol are shown. The patterns
observed in acetonitrile were similar, but with a smaller impact of the stationary phase selectivity. Generally, the retention is higher for both ionized
acids and bases on the classical C 8 packing. However, since the XTerra MS
packing is well deactivated, the patterns for the ionic compounds do not
differ much from the patterns for general neutral compounds. Analytes
with the ability to hydrogen bond to the embedded carbamate group are
more retained on the XTerra RP 8 packing. These include phenols, sulfonamides, and non-ionized acids, with the strongest effect for the first two
classes of compounds. It should be pointed out that the hydrogen bonding
ability of phenols is lost when the phenol group becomes ionized. The same
is true for the hydrogen bonding ability of carboxylic acids.
The selectivity differences between EPG packings and classical packings are exciting. However, they have a larger MS bleed than C18 packings, which bothers some LC/MS users. The bleed is not due to a larger
ligand loss compared to a standard C~8 packing, but rather due to the
much greater ease of ionization of the ligand, which is caused by the
embedded polar group. The user needs to decide, if the significant advantages of well-designed EPG packings outweigh this drawback.
Several different types of phenyl ligands are commercially available.
They all share a phenyl group, but the attachment to the surface and the
length of the chain between the surface and the ligand varies. The common linker is a three-carbon chain, but newer materials have a six-carbon

spacer (phenylhexyl packings). The phenyl group shows ~-~ interactions
with suitable analytes. Most analytes of interest in the pharmaceutical
industry contain aromatic rings and one often sees selectivity differences
when switching from a C 8 or a C18 packing to a phenyl packing.
However, in many cases these selectivity differences are rather small,
which actually may be more of a benefit than a detriment. In some special cases, the selectivity and retention differences between a phenylhexyl
packing and a C18 packing can be striking. Figure 3 shows this for the
analysis of a set of explosives standards, carried out on 1.7-~tm particles
using ultra-high-pressure LC (see also Section III.C). Due to the ~-~
bonding, the phenylhexyl column exhibits a larger retention and a significant selectivity difference compared to the C18 packing.
There are two principal types of perfluorinated packings: one is the
aliphatic perfluoro octyl packing and the other one is the aromatic
pentafluoro phenyl (PFP) packing. Due to the larger steric hindrance
around the more bulky fluorinated groups, the coating levels are usually
lower than those for equivalent non-fluorinated packings. As a consequence, both packings exhibit a larger amount of silanol interactions
than their non-fluorinated counterparts. Therefore, it is often difficult to
determine which selectivity effects stem from the ligand, and which originate in the increased level of silanol interaction. For example, the retention of bases is enhanced on typical PFP packings, which cannot be

explained readily by a specific interaction with the ligand. Selectivity differences between a perfluoro octyl packing and a standard C18 are rather
small, except for those that could be attributed to surface silanols.
Cyano (CN) packings have been around since the beginning of HPLC,
largely due to their success in GC. However, in LC, many users became

S~

U.D. NEUE et al.

disenchanted with CN packings. This is largely due to multiple stability
issues, but not due to a lack of selectivity difference compared to a C~8. The
standard ligand is a propyl cyano ligand. The attachment to the surface can
be done with the use of a monofunctional silane or a trifunctional silane.
Due to the shorter chain length and the polar functional group, CN packings are significantly less retentive in reversed-phase HPLC compared to C 8
or C18 packings. Due to the difficulties with existing packings, the use of
CN packings is not recommended.

2. Selectivity
The general selectivity properties of commercial reversed-phase
columns are of significant interest to the applied chromatographer. Several
researchers have dedicated large resources to attempt to characterize the
main features of commercially available columns. 1~ Reference 28
(Chapter 4 in this book) describes the approach by one group of authors.
The most erudite method and the most inclusive overview of different
packings can be found in reference 26, with a recent refinement of the
method in reference 27. However, with the exception of the judgment
about the hydrophobicity of different packings, the agreement between the
different methods is rather p o o r . 14 The reasons for these discrepancies are
not understood. One possibility is that the mobile phase plays a more significant role, and that the dismissal of its influence is the underlying cause
for the differences between the characterization methods. From the standpoint of the practitioner, this simply means that one needs to look at the
described column features as paintings that have been created with a broad
brush, and that one can only extract a general character of a column from
the measured values. However, this is still of significant value.
In the following, we will discuss the data collected by us using the
method described in reference 13. We have measured the retention of a
purely hydrophobic compound, acenaphthene, and that of a compound
that shows a strong interaction with surface silanols, amitriptyline, in a
methanol/buffer 65.0/35.0 (v/v) mobile phase. The buffer is a 2 0 m M
pH 7.0 phosphate buffer. The logarithm of the retention factor of acenaphthene is the yardstick for the hydrophobicity of the packings. From
the logarithm of the relative retention between acenaphthene and
amitriptyline, a measure for the activity of the surface silanols is derived.
This is demonstrated in Figure 4. In this figure, the silanol activity is plotted versus the hydrophobicity of the packings. C18 packings are marked
with a black square and C 8 packings with a gray square. Generally, C18
packings are more hydrophobic than C 8 packings, but this is not always
the case, since the retention for a purely hydrophobic compound depends
also on the ligand density and the phase ratio of the parent silica. The circles mark phenyl packings and the diamonds are CN packings. Most
phenyl packings are less hydrophobic than C 8 packings, and CN packings
are the most polar packings. The stars represent fluorinated packings.

Hydrophobicity
F I G U R E 4 Selectivity chart summary. Designation of packings: black squares: CIs, gray squares:
C8, circles: phenyl, diamonds: cyano, stars: fluorinated packings, triangles: packings with embedded
polar groups, small back diamonds: uncategorized packings. Reprinted from reference 43.

The packings marked by a triangle are all packings with an embedded
polar group. They clearly show a much lower silanol activity than the
packings lacking this feature. This is a general advantage in method development. A line is drawn that shows the difference between packings with
an embedded polar group and those packings that lack this feature.
In Figure 5, plots of the values of the silanol activity versus the
hydrophobicity are shown for 148 packings. Figure 5a is drawn at the
same scale as Figure 4, which was used to orient the reader in the chart.
Figure 5b is a magnified view of the indicated section of (a), and (c) is a
magnification of (b). The charts cover a broad selection of different
packings, from older stationary phases based on low-purity silicas to
newer packings based on high-purity silica, to packings based on hybrid
particles. The packings were selected from commercial sources in different parts of the world. Occasionally, some packings were tested multiple
times to check the reproducibility of the packings. Therefore, the chart
contains more data points than packings.
Some packings with a very high silanol activity such as the Zorbax
Classic or the Resolve C18 were not included in this chart due to the
extremely high silanol activity. The same holds true for unendcapped C30
packings such as the YMC C30. Among the remaining packings, the
highest silanol activity on the chart is found for Waters Spherisorb
Phenyl (#4), followed by Platinum EPS (#18). Low silanol activity is

shown for all the types of packings with embedded polar groups. The
polyethylene-glycol-derivatized Discovery HS PEG (#121) marks the
bottom of the chart.
The most hydrophobically retentive packing on the chart is YMCPack Pro RS combined with a silanol activity typical of high-purity
silicas (#118). Intermediate hydrophobicity for a Cl8-type packing is
exhibited by XTerra MS C18 (#84). The most polar stationary phase on
the chart is the Nova-Pak CN HP packing (#1). The reader is encouraged
to examine the three selectivity charts in detail to find the positions of his
or her favorite packings.
Today, many automated method development schemes use a parallel
exploration of the selectivity of different columns. Based on the characteristics of the packings described here and in the previous paragraph, we have
recommended to use a classical C 8 or C18, a short-chain or long-chain EPG
column, and a phenyl column together with the selectivity of the mobile
phase to search for a quick start in method development. 29 A typical scheme
would use one of each type of columns, methanol and acetonitrile as solvents, and, if the analytes are ionizable, pH as the primary tools in the
exploration of separation selectivity. Subsequently, mobile phase composition and temperature can be used for a method fine-tuning. Such a scenario
uses every one of these principal selectivity parameters with maximal effect.
These different selectivity characteristics can even be found within a
given family of packings. The advantage of such an approach lies in other
common factors of the packings. For example, the family of XBridge
packings exhibits an excellent chemical stability at alkaline pH. At the
same time, the character of the surfaces is measurably different. We can
find the packings of this family on Figure 5b (connected lines): XBridge
C 8 (#136) is found on the left side of the graph. The most hydrophobic
packing in this family is XBridge C~8 (#143). The packing with the lowest silanol activity is the one with the incorporated polar group XBridge
Shield RP18 (#130). The XBridge Phenyl packing (#142) has an intermediate hydrophobicity, but also shows selective ~-~ interaction typical of
the phenyl packings (see Section II.C.1). When combined with mobile
phase selectivity, these different stationary phase characteristics maximize
the chances that a suitable separation will be found rapidly. 29
3. Other Techniques: HILIC and Mixed-Mode Phases

In the majority of this chapter, we are focusing on reversed-phase
chromatography, since it is the most commonly used technique in the
pharmaceutical industry. However, some alternative techniques may be
of advantage under appropriate circumstances. One of these techniques
is hydrophilic interaction chromatography, commonly abbreviated as
HILIC. Like reversed-phase chromatography, aqueous-organic mobile
phases are used. However, the stationary phases are very polar, and
thus the overall retention patterns are opposite to what is found with

3

HPLCCOLUMNSAND PACKINGS

63

reversed-phase chromatography. The most common organic modifier is
acetonitrile, and retention increases with an increase of acetonitrile in the
mobile phase, and decreases with the addition of water. A good overview
of the application of this technique for bioanalytical LC/MS can be
found in reference 30.
The basic mechanism of HILIC is partitioning of the analytes from the
acetonitrile-rich mobile phase to the water-rich surface of the packing. 2 In
other words, more polar compounds such as sugars are well retained,
while hydrophobic compounds such as toluene are unretained and can
serve as void-volume markers. In addition, some of the commercial packings used for HILIC also have ion-exchange properties, which can be
advantageous for improving the separation or altering retention. It should
be mentioned here that HILIC methods have been demonstrated to yield
superior sensitivity in applications where electrospray mass spectrometry
is used as the detection technique. 3~The improvement in sensitivity is often
one order of magnitude, and may occasionally reach much higher values. 31
The classical HILIC application is the separation of sugars on silicabased propylamino columns. 32 Due to stability issues with a standard
amino column, modern "carbohydrate columns" are stabilized to overcome this difficulty. Also, polymer-based amino columns are available for
this application. Due to the amine function, these columns can also be
used in a combination of HILIC with an anion-exchange mechanism.
Underivatized silica columns can also be used for HILIC applications. In
this case, the polar surface of the silica is responsible for the attraction of
the water from the mobile phase. In the case of silica, the HILIC retention
mechanism is supported by cation-exchange with the surface silanols. 3~ It
needs to be mentioned that in HILIC, silanols are not a detriment. The
tailing observed with silanol-rich packings in reversed-phase chromatography is due to the fact that the silanols are few in number and buried
under the hydrophobic C18 layer. In HILIC, the silanols are on the surface
and easily accessible. Therefore, they can interact freely and without steric
hindrance with the analytes. Thus, tailing is observed only rarely.
A modern development in HILIC are zwitterionic stationary phases.
The structure of the group responsible for the retention is shown below:

I
Phases with such groups can be prepared on silica and on organic
polymers, and both forms of this packing are commercially available.
Note that the opposite charges balance each other. The retention is created by the preferential binding of water by the charged groups. These
packings work equally well for anionic, cationic, and neutral analytes.

64

U.D. NEUE et al.

Another recent development of interest is the use of mixed-mode
stationary phases, where hydrophobic interaction is combined with an
ion-exchange mechanism. In these stationary phases, ion-exchange groups
are incorporated into a reversed-phase ligand. Several different combinations of this type are commercially available, combining strong and weak
cationic and anionic functions on the surface with reversed-phase ligands.
Details about the structure of the ligands are unfortunately not available.
Mixed-mode stationary phases on the basis of polymeric packings have
been used extensively in sample preparation. 33 In this case, a packing prepared from divinylbenzene and N-vinyl pyrrolidone is partially derivatized
with sulfonic acid groups, carboxylic acid groups, quaternary ammonium
groups, or tertiary amino groups to create strong and weak cation and
anion exchangers. Such packings interact both via the ion-exchange groups
as well as via the hydrophobic matrix (divinylbenzene). Applications
include the sample preparation of plasma and urine samples prior to HPLC
analysis, often in combination with MS detection. Generally, it was found
that techniques using the mixed-mode packings resulted in cleaner HPLC
samples with significantly less ion-suppression in MS.
Occasionally, good sample preparation techniques can be combined
in an optimal way with HILIC as the analytical technique prior to
MS detection. Next, we will describe an interesting application that combines the sample cleanup with the column chemistry and the detection.
The ionizable analyte in a (rat) plasma sample is cleaned up via solidphase extraction using a mixed-mode ion-exchange technique. The elution solvent in this technique is methanol to eliminate hydrophobic
interaction, together with an acid or a base to break the ion-exchange
interaction. 33 This sample can subsequently be injected directly (i.e. without evaporation to dryness and reconstitution in another solvent) onto a
HILIC column. Under HILIC conditions, methanol is a weak eluent and
therefore a rather large injection volume is possible. Retention is further
enhanced for basic compounds, if the HILIC column is a silica column,
since the ion exchange with surface silanols assists the HILIC process. If
the detection method is ESI-MS, one can achieve a higher sensitivity in
mobile phases that are rich in organic solvent, as is typical for a HILIC
method. 3~Such a strategy takes full advantage of the sample preparation,
column chemistries, and detector sensitivity available.
D. Monolithic Structures

Since their inception in the mid-1990s, monolithic structures have
inspired the imagination of chromatographers. However, the practice
has remained far behind these early expectations.
What are monoliths? They are continuous structures of the stationary phase, with a continuous macropore structure that provides the channels for the flow of the mobile phase. 34 The stationary phase can be

3

HPLC COLUMNS AND PACKINGS

65

porous or non-porous, with the same drawbacks of a non-porous structure as exhibited by non-porous beads in packed beds. In standard monoliths, the internal pore structure, also called micropores, provides the
surface area necessary to achieve adequate retention in chromatography.
Monoliths are available based on both silica 3s and organic polymers. 36 Most of the following discussion will focus on silica monoliths.
With packed beds, the volume of the interstitial channels between
the particles is typically 40% of the column volume (it is a bit higher for
irregular-shaped particles, and it may also be somewhat lower for spherical particles, depending on the properties of those particles). The size of
these interstitial channels determines the backpressure of the column,
while the size of the particles determines the column performance. With
a fixed interstitial volume fraction, the column performance and the column backpressure are simultaneously determined by the particle size in
packed beds.
With monoliths, this link no longer exists. Thus, it is possible to create structures with a larger interstitial fraction combined with a smaller
characteristic size for the stationary phase than would have been possible
with a packed bed. Since the backpressure depends inversely to roughly
the fifth power on the interstitial fraction (in the range of 40% interstitial
fraction), one can gain significantly by creating a more open monolithic
structure. On the other hand, new methods for achieving a high level of
macroscopic structural uniformity could lead to further improvements.
The analysis of the performance of standard commercial monoliths 37
showed that the chromatographic performance (van Deemter A-term) of
the devices examined was similar to a well-packed bed of 3.5-5-~tm particles, while the backpressure was equivalent to that of a column packed
with 8-10-l.tm particles. This gives a clear impression of the performance
advantage of a standard monolith. At the same time, the pressure that can
be applied to a commercial monolith is limited by the fact that the encasement of the column is made out of PEEKTM,which limits the pressure that
the column can be exposed to (and thus the speed of analysis that can be
achieved). Commercial silica monoliths are still limited to a single internal
diameter. Within these constraints, good performance can be achieved.
Organic monoliths are commercially available as well, but they are
primarily used as media in the separation of large molecular weight
compounds, mostly biomolecules. Typical applications include proteins,
peptides, or DNA fragments. A study of the operational variables in

In the pharmaceutical industry, the reproducibility of a separation is of utmost importance. Once a separation has been developed,

~6

it is expected that it can be transferred to other departments (e.g. QC
department) or to other locations, often in other parts of the world,
without any difficulties. The method developers also count on the stability of the method over long periods of time, i.e. decades. Both of
these subjects have several implications.
First of all, after the completion of method development, it is very
important to test the reproducibility of a method from instrument to
instrument, and from column to column. With respect to the column
reproducibility, it is also worthwhile to compare used and new columns,
and columns containing different preparations (= batches) of the packing
material. Major column manufacturers can supply such columns, and
some have such column sets in their standard offering. The comparison
of a used column and a brand-new column ensures that the method is
indeed reproducible. The comparison between columns from the same
batch of material should give essentially identical results. The comparison between different preparations of the packing material gives an indication of the long-term reproducibility of a method. Good results
increase the comfort of the QC department that the method will be stable over long periods of time.
Second, the choice of columns used in method development needs to
take into consideration the distribution capability of the column manufacturer. Many pharmaceutical companies have manufacturing sites in
different parts of the world, and the same column needs to be readily
available in different countries.
The third point is the capability of the column manufacturer to
ensure a long-term supply of the packing. This is more likely, if the column supplier is an integrated manufacturer. This means that the column
manufacturer synthesizes the raw silica and does the surface bonding and
column manufacturing. Some column manufacturers do not have the
capability to synthesize the raw silica. Thus, they depend on another supplier to provide them with the silica. This has consequences for the security of the supply, and potentially, also the reproducibility of the final
product.
The quality of the batch QC-test of the column manufacturer
together with reproducibility data of a packing material can also be
taken into account in the selection of columns deemed for the development of QC procedures. Such data have, for example, been published in
reference 39. Data on the long-term reproducibility of packings are also
available from manufacturers upon request. An example of a dataset on
the long-term reproducibility of one packing is shown in Figure 6.
Relative retention values are plotted versus the batch numbers of all
released batches of the product. The range of each retention window is
_ 10% around the mean value. Let us discuss briefly the different values
measured and the meaning of these values. The simplest value is
the hydrophobic selectivity measured by the relative retention between

acenaphthene and naphthalene (Figure 6E). This value has a relative
standard deviation of < 0.4%. As discussed above, the relative retention
between a base and a neutral purely hydrophobic reference compound is
a measure of the silanol group activity of a packing (Figure 6C and G).
The test is carried out at pH 7.0, where the partial ionization of the surface silanols critically influences the retention of the positively charged
base. The standard deviations of the relative retention of both bases to
acenaphthene are around 2%. The relative retention between both bases
(Figure 6B) is a measure of access to the surface silanols: one base is a
secondary amine and the other a tertiary amine. The standard deviation
of this value is 1.2%. The relative retention values between dipropylphthalate and acenaphthene (Figure 6D) and between butylparaben and
acenaphthene (Figure 6F) reflect hydrogen bond acceptor and hydrogen
bond donor activity of the surface. The first parameter has a standard
deviation of 1.5% and the second one a value of 2.0%. The relative
retention between the two polar compounds dipropylphthalate and
butylparaben (Figure 6A) is a direct measure of the hydrogen bonding
capability of the packing (without reference to hydrophobic interaction),
and it exhibits a standard deviation of < 0.9% for this packing. It should

68

also be mentioned that the retention factor of acenaphthene itself has a
standard deviation of 2.7%. However, the reproducibility of the selectivity factors is a much better and more important indicator of the reproducibility of a packing than the reproducibility of the retention factors.

III. SPEED AND RESOLUTION
In this section, we will discuss the impact of column length and particle size on the performance of a separation. On first glance, it is already
clear that it is not possible to run very fast separations on a long column
packed with very small size particles. Conversely, we can also imagine
that the separation capability of a short column packed with rather large
particles is limited. In the following, we will attempt to shed some light
on column performance capabilities in both isocratic and gradient chromatographies.

A. Column Performance in Isocratic Chromatography
The foundation of the views presented here is a series of publications
by Martin, Eon, and Guiochon in the mid-1970s. 4~ Later publications 2'43 c o v e r the material in a similar fashion as described here.
In isocratic chromatography, the analysis of column performance is
very straightforward, and we can visualize what is happening with little
difficulty. Let us assume that we have a 15-cm 5-~tm column with an
internal diameter of 4.6 mm! We typically will operate this column at a
flow rate of I mL/min. Now, let us take a standard separation, and let us
increase the flow rate. The separation is happening faster and the peaks
are narrower in time units, but we also will loose some resolution, since
the peaks will be getting a bit wider compared to the distance between
the peaks, as we increase the flow. If we do not have a tight pair of peaks
in our chromatogram, we can still recognize that the peaks are getting
wider with higher flow rate, since they are also getting shorter. At some
point, we cannot increase the flow rate any further, because we would
have reached the pressure limit of the instrument.
What will happen, if we do the same thing with a 25-cm column, or
with a 5-cm column, packed with the same size particles (5 ~tm)? We will
start off with a higher plate count on the 25-cm column, but we will also
hit the instrument pressure limit at a lower flow rate than with the
15-cm column. Conversely, the 5-cm column will have a much lower
plate count, but we will be able to operate it with three times the flow rate
as the 15-cm column. Figure 7 puts these thoughts into a graphic format.
Plotted is the square root of the plate count (which is proportional to the
resolution of the separation) versus the analysis time for these three
columns. We call the y-axis the "resolving power" of a separation. The

x-axis is the analysis time. We can clearly see the pattern of the change
in column performance when we change the column length for the three
5-~tm columns.
Also included in Figure 7 is the case, when we try to get even more
resolving power out of a column by changing the particle size in the 25-cm
column to 3 pm. Indeed, we do get what we had wanted, but the analysis time range over which this column can be used is very limited. If we
run too slowly, we loose column performance (longitudinal diffusion
takes over). We cannot run any faster, since we quickly reach the pressure limit with the 3-pm particles.
The results in Figure 7 are not unexpected. Longer columns have
more resolving power, shorter columns provide a faster separation.
Reducing the particle size gains resolving power (for a given column
length), but it limits the speed of analysis that can be achieved.
There is another way though to think about column performance. This
second way will gain speed and often also separation performance at the
same time. Let us now change column length and particle size in proportion to each other! Let us compare the performance patterns of a 25-cm
5-pm, a 15-cm 3-pm, and a 10-cm 2-pm column to each other! In this case,
the ratio of column length to particle size remains constant. The performance pattern for this set of columns is shown in Figure 8 up to a pressure
of 4000 psi (266 bar). Now, each of these columns has the same maximum
resolving power. However, as we decrease the particle size, this maximum

resolving power is reached in a shorter analysis time. At the point of maximum column performance, the 3-~tm column is about 2.8 times faster than
the 5-~m column. In addition, we see that all three columns have the same
limiting short analysis time. Given the pressure limit, the 10-cm 2-~tm column cannot be operated any faster than the 25-cm 5-~tm column, but it
reaches the maximum column performance at a very short run time.
We have seen now that the maximum column performance remains
constant when we change the column length and the particle size in the
same proportion. We also have seen that the fastest analysis that can be
performed on columns scaled this way remains constant. The advantage
of the shorter column with the smaller particles is only that the resolving
power at or close to the speed limit is higher for the smaller particles.
How do we get then to a faster analysis? We have to reduce the ratio
of column length to particle size. Alternatively, if we want to maintain
maximum column performance, we need to go to an instrument that can
provide a higher pressure. We cover the latter aspects in Section III.C.
Let us see what happens when we choose another ratio of column
length to particle size! In Figure 9, we examine a 5-cm 5-~tm, a 3-cm 3-~tm,
and a 2-cm 2-~tm column. Once again we see that all three columns have
the same maximum plate count, all three columns can achieve the same
shortest analysis time. The maximum resolving power is a little bit less
than one half of what was achievable with the five times longer columns
shown in Figure 8. But the speed is much higher: the fastest analysis at a

pressure of 3000 psi (200 bar) is just around 40 s for our standard analysis to a retention factor of 10. Of course, the smaller particle sizes always
outperform the larger particles. Quite reasonable analyses can be performed in less than 2 min with either the 3-pm or the 2-1am columns.
Obviously, the focus of the use of columns with a small ratio of column
length to particle size is the speed of the analysis, not the maximum
separation power.
Before we conclude this section, it should be mentioned that the exact
speed values that can be achieved depend on the viscosity of the mobile
phase. In our examples, we assumed a viscosity of I cP, the value for water.
If one is using a methanol-water mobile phase, the speed will be a bit
slower, whereas for acetonitrile-based mobile phases, it will be a bit higher.
However, in these comparisons it was more important to understand the
influence of the column parameters such as column length and particle size.

B. Column Performance in Gradient Chromatography
The same principles that we have just applied to isocratic chromatography also apply to gradients. Despite the fact that the use of gradients complicates the picture a bit, the overall rules are similar to what
we have seen in isocratic chromatography. We should use a fixed ratio
of column length to particle size for the column comparisons in the same

way as we have done in isocratic chromatography. We will assume a
fixed gradient from 0% to 100% organic for all the comparisons. In
order to measure the separation performance of the gradient, we use the
peak capacity, defined as the gradient run time tg divided by the average
peak width w in the gradient:

Pc - 1 + - -

tg

(3)

w

This is simply a measure of how many peaks could be eluted with a
nearly baseline separation in a given gradient run time. Other measures
for judging the performance of a gradient can be used as well (e.g. reference 44), but the overall findings remain essentially unchanged.
In Figure 10, we have plotted the dependence of the peak capacity
on the operational parameters flow rate and gradient run time for three
different columns. Before discussing the details of the graphs, let us
examine first the nature of the plot. Note that both the flow rate axis and
the axis of the gradient duration are logarithmic. This permits a display
of the column performance over a wide range of operating conditions.
First, let us look at the conditions of a very long gradient run time, which
was 512 min (=approximately 8 h) at the back end of the graphs. Under
these circumstances, the peak capacity exhibits a maximum. The location of the maximum is at a slow flow rate, close to the optimum of the
relationship between plate count and flow rate in isocratic chromatography. As we shorten the gradient run time, the maximum of the peak
capacity moves to higher velocities. It also becomes lower. Generally, we
obtain maximum resolution, and therefore the best peak capacity, at
slow flow rates. However, an analysis time of 8 h or so is not practical.
Most gradient analyses are carried out with run times less than I h, often
even much faster than this. A 30-min analysis is pretty much in the center of the graphs. The flow rate at which the maximum of the peak
capacity occurs for this gradient run time is around I mL/min for a column with an internal diameter of 3.9 mm. This is in good agreement with
the standard operating practices in many labs: gradient run time about
30 min, flow rate about I mL/min. The graphs stop on the right at the
flow rate where we reach the pressure limit of the instrumentation. In
our calculations, this limit was assumed to be around 6000 psi (400 bar).

three columns with an internal diameter of 3.9 m m . T h e logarithmic axis for the gradient duration tg is same for all three graphs and ranges from 4 to 512 min.The logarithmic axis for the flow rate varies from graph to graph. (a) Column: 300 m m x 3.9 m m ,

Now that we have oriented ourselves in the graphs, let us examine
them in more detail. In all three graphs, the maximum of the peak capacity at a particular gradient run time moves to a higher flow rate as the gradient run time becomes shorter. The reason for this observation is simple.
If we reduce the gradient run time at a particular flow rate, the gradient
volume becomes smaller, and we lose resolution. If we want to compensate for this, we need to increase the flow rate. The increase in flow rate
brings with it a reduction in column plate count. Therefore, a reduction in
run time will always be accompanied by a reduction in peak capacity, but
it is not that bad if we increase the flow rate at the same time.
Let us now compare the three graphs in Figure 10 to each other!
Figure 10a shows the gradient performance of a 30-cm 10-1am column.
Figure 10b represents a 15-cm 5-jam column, and Figure 10c a 10-cm
3.5-1am column. We see that the performance at very long run times
improves substantially from the 10-1am column to the 5-1am column, but
the increase in peak capacity at the longest run time is only small going
from the 5-1am column to the 3-jam column. This is in agreement with the
experience shown above for isocratic chromatography: there is a gain in
speed, when we reduce the column length together with the particle size,
but for the longer run times, the gain in performance is small. However,
when we look at the front of the graph, at quick gradient times as fast as
4 min, the advantage of the shorter column packed with smaller particles
is substantial (about 30% improvement in peak capacity). At the same
time, we are operating close to the selected pressure limit. However, if
we compare the gain in speed for equal performance, we can obtain the
same peak capacity with the 3.5-1am column in about 4 min as was possible with the 10-gm column in about 30 min.
The smaller particles provide a gain in speed, even in gradient separations. This gain is more pronounced, if we select shorter columns. This
is shown in Figure 11, where we compare the peak capacities for 2.1-mm
columns of a shorter length. Here we compare 10-cm 10-1am, 5-cm 5-1am,
and 2.5-cm 2.5-1am columns. The fastest analysis time considered is a
1-min analysis. The 10-1am column only delivers a peak capacity of
around 13, completely inadequate for a real analysis. The 5-~tm column
reaches a peak capacity of 22. Only the 2.5-1am column reaches an adequate peak capacity, i.e. 37, for this fast analysis. The flow rate is also
fairly high for such a short column: I mL/min, in agreement with data
for fast gradients reported in the literature. 4s,46

C. The Need for Pressure

It is clear that smaller particles are of advantage if one wants to
achieve a reasonably high performance at very short analyses times.
At the same time, the pressure required to operate a column increases
drastically. At a given flow rate, the pressure grows inversely to the
square of the particle size. However, the flow rate needed to reach the
optimum performance of columns packed with small particles also
increases, as the particle size decreases. The consequence of both facts is
that the pressure to operate a column under the best conditions increases
with the inverse of the third power of the particle size. If we had been comfortable at 750psi (50 bar) with 3.5-gm particles, we will need 6000psi
(400 bar) to operate the same column packed with 1.7-gm particles at
the optimum flow. On the other hand, the gain in speed and performance is very much worth the effort. An example of an isocratic separation that takes advantage of the smaller particles at a constant column
length is shown in Figure 12. The measured gain in resolution was
1.5-fold, while the separation was 2.6 times faster. The consequence was

a roughly 22-fold increase in pressure. All of these figures are in close
agreement with the theoretical expectations. There is no question of the
gain in performance from the very small particles. There is also no question that the cost of this improvement is pressure.
Similar analyses can also be made if the column length is reduced
with the particle size, as we have done above. We have shown there
that under these circumstances, the performance optimum changes to
shorter and shorter run times, as the particle size is reduced. If we continue to do this, we will at some point reach this performance maximum
at the pressure limit of the instrument. The only way to further continue
on this path towards increased performance is to increase the available
pressure.
Small particles are also of advantage for separations that require a
very large horsepower in a reasonable time. The first examples of the use
of very high pressure by Jorgenson and co-workers focused on maximizing column plate count. 47 In a later publication, the benefit of very small
particles was demonstrated also for gradient applications. 48 In more
recent times, the instrumentation to execute separations that require a
higher pressure and the columns needed for high-power separations have
become commercially available. 49 At the time of this writing, a typical particle size for ultra-performance LC applications is 1.7 ~tm (as in Figure 12)
with column lengths up to 15 cm.
An example of an analysis that requires a very high separation
power is metabolite profiling in biofluids, i.e. the science of metabonomics. 5~ Also, impurity profiling does benefit from the improvement in
separation power. Finally, further reduction of interferences in the
LC/MS analysis of drugs in biofluids is possible by increasing the peak
capacity of the chromatographic separation. The improved separation
power results in fewer coelutions for each peak. Fewer interferences
mean less ion suppression, which was the surprising side benefit of the
performance increase due to small particles when complex separations
were performed with MS detection.

IV. SPECIALTY COLUMNS FROM NANOBORE TO PREPARATIVE CHROMATOGRAPHY

In this section, we will briefly touch the subject of columns with both
a wider and a smaller internal diameter than commonly used in HPLC.
The technology of column preparation has not stood still at these fringes
of standard column technology. However, special equipment is required
to use these columns. For the proper use of preparative columns, pumps
with higher flow rates and injectors with a larger injection volume are
required. For the use of columns with a very small diameter, the main
technological difficulty is the design of sensitive detectors with very small
extra-column band spreading.

A. Preparative Columns
Preparative chromatography can be carried out at many different
levels. The preparation of milligram quantities of purified substances
from crude synthesis product has become commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry. Often, open-access systems are available that allow an
automated purification of the crude product with pre-established chromatographic methods.
The packings used in an open-access preparative system are identical to
the ones used for chromatographic analysis. The commonly used particle
size is 5 lam, and the common column length is 50 mm, but longer lengths
are used as well. Common column diameters range from 7.8 to 30 mm.
The loadability of a column can be estimated by the rule of thumb
that column overload will deteriorate a separation if more than i mg of
sample per I g of packing is injected. Another good rule of thumb is that
a column contains about 0.75 g of packing per milliliter of column volume. Table 1 gives an estimate of how much sample can be injected on
columns of various dimensions before significant overload occurs.
Of course, these values need to be taken as guidelines, since for example
an overload of the mobile phase buffer or the influence of the sample solvent can result in peak distortion at much smaller injections. A special
injection technique, at-column dilution, can be employed to get around
early peak distortion due to the sample solvent, sl In this technique, the
sample is injected onto the column in a solvent stream that is compatible
with the sample, and this solvent stream is converted just in front of the
column to the mobile phase composition required to get good retention
and loadability in the preparative chromatography.

HPLC COLUMNS AND PACKINGS

79

Most preparative columns have some special hardware to stabilize
the packed bed. Common techniques used for this purpose are various
forms of axial or radial compression. Column stability is improved by
increasing the packed bed density. Columns of this type have demonstrably a more predictable lifetime than columns without such features.
B. From Microbore to Nanobore

Columns with diameters of about 4 mm continue to be the most commonly used columns in HPLC. Due to the high linear velocities needed for
fast analysis, 2.1-mm columns are often used for very rapid applications.
Recently, 2.1- and l-ram columns have been used for analyses requiring
a higher pressure, since the heat generated from the pressure can be dissipated better with a smaller column diameter. Smaller volume columns
also generate a higher detector response for equal sample amounts
injected, which is of advantage in the analysis of small sample quantities.
Thus, there are advantages in the use of smaller diameter columns.
There could be several reasons for the use of columns with a smaller
internal diameter. Some MS detectors work best at flow rates lower than
standard HPLC flow rates. Fast separations need to be carried out at a
high linear velocity. This is best achieved by using a smaller column
diameter. In this case, the diameter is best chosen to be around 2 mm.
Solvent consumption in a high-throughput lab can be of concern. Under
these circumstances, the use of a 3-mm column is often the best solution,
since the standard HPLC equipment can be used with little modification.
A modern low-dispersion system with a small gradient delay volume is
needed for the successful implementation of 3-mm columns.
Another important reason for the use of smaller diameter columns
is a limit in the available sample volume. However, as the column
diameter is reduced, the peak volumes become smaller as well. The
smaller peak volumes require a smaller detector volume (or better, a
lower post-column band spreading). If this is not done, the extra-column band spreading can deteriorate the separation. At the same time,
a smaller detector volume often goes along with a reduced sensitivity of
the detector. Thus, one needs to carefully think which column volumes
go along with which detector volumes to not deteriorate the separation
power of the columns by too much or compromise detector sensitivity
by too much. Part of this thought process should also be the consideration of a sample enrichment on the column by dissolving the sample
in a solvent composition that is a weaker eluent than the mobile phase.
This permits a larger injection volume, and thus a larger sensitivity, i.e.
better limits of detection and quantitation.
There is a reasonable rule of thumb (for isocratic chromatography)
that helps in the choice of the right column for the right detector or vice
versa: the standard deviation of the system band spreading should not

80

exceed 1% of the retention volume of the first peak of interest in the
chromatogram. For a 15cm 3< 4.6mm column with 10,000 plates, this
means that the system band spreading should not exceed 16 laL if the
unretained peak is important. Conversely, if only retained peaks are
important, a 3-mm column with the same performance can be run on the
same system. For a column with an internal diameter of 100 ~tm, a system band spreading not exceeding 25 nL is desirable. However, these are
rough guidelines that should be checked against the performance of the
actual column/detector combination.

V. SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have described HPLC columns and packings. The
first part deals with the chemistry of the packings, covering both the surface chemistry as well as the solid support matrix. This is followed by a
discussion of the physical properties of the columns, i.e. column dimensions and particle sizes. Finally, a section has been devoted to unusual column dimensions. In all cases, special attention has been paid to items that
we feel are important for HPLC users in the pharmaceutical industry.
