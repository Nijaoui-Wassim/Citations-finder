Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The field of metabolomics has witnessed an exponential growth in the last decade driven by
important applications spanning a wide range of areas in the basic and life sciences and beyond.
Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance are the
two major analytical avenues for the analysis of metabolic species in complex biological mixtures.
Owing to its inherent significantly higher sensitivity and fast data acquisition, MS plays an
increasingly dominant role in the metabolomics field. Propelled by the need to develop simple
methods to diagnose and manage the numerous and widespread human diseases, mass
spectrometry has witnessed tremendous growth with advances in instrumentation, experimental
methods, software, and databases. In response, the metabolomics field has moved far beyond
qualitative methods and simple pattern recognition approaches to a range of global and targeted
quantitative approaches that are now routinely used and provide reliable data, which instill greater
confidence in the derived inferences. Powerful isotope labeling and tracing methods have become
very popular. The newly emerging ambient ionization techniques such as desorption ionization
and rapid evaporative ionization have allowed direct MS analysis in real time, as well as new MS
imaging approaches. While the MS-based metabolomics has provided insights into metabolic
pathways and fluxes, and metabolite biomarkers associated with numerous diseases, the increasing
realization of the extremely high complexity of biological mixtures underscores numerous
challenges including unknown metabolite identification, biomarker validation, and interlaboratory
reproducibility that need to be dealt with for realization of the full potential of MS-based
metabolomics. This chapter provides a glimpse at the current status of the mass spectrometrybased metabolomics field highlighting the opportunities and challenges.

1 Brief History of Metabolic Profiling
Although metabolic profiling or metabolomics is considered a relatively new field in
systems biology, the first reports of metabolic studies can be traced to the ancient China,
where ants were used to detect diabetes by evaluating the levels of glucose in urine samples
[1]. “Urine charts” correlating smell, taste, and color of urine were employed in the Middle

Ages to diagnose various medical conditions that are metabolic in origin [2]. The idea that
individuals might have a distinctive “metabolic pattern” that could be “fingerprinted” by
studying their biological fluids was proposed and tested by Roger Williams and his coworkers in late 1940s [3]. They utilized paper chromatography to determine that metabolic
patterns significantly varied among different subjects, but were relatively constant for a
given individual. Their studies of a variety of subjects including alcoholics and
schizophrenics produced the evidence that each of these groups has a particular metabolic
pattern. The technological advances in gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography
(LC), and mass spectrometry (MS) in the 1960s and 1970s allowed quantitative metabolic
profiling studies. Horning and co-workers in 1971 successfully used GC-MS to measure
metabolites in human urine and tissue extracts [4, 5]. Horning, along with Pauling and
Robinson and their research groups, led the development of GC-MS-based techniques for
the metabolic measurements in biological fluids through the 1970s to early 1980s [6]. Later,
developments of high-resolution/sensitivity MS and NMR instrumentation in combination
with multivariate statistical analysis have allowed metabolomics to become a fast-growing
field in system biology over the past decade.

Metabolomics is having major impacts on numerous disciplines including the life, food and
plant sciences, drug development, toxicology, environmental science, and medicine.
Metabolites, being the downstream products of cellular function, represent a sensitive
measure of the actions of upstream molecular species such as genes, transcripts, and
enzymes, including the effects of disease, drugs, toxicity, and the environment. Hence,
identification and quantitative analysis of metabolites in humans and animal and cell models
of numerous human diseases offer avenues for understanding, diagnosing, and managing
human diseases; assessing disease risk factors associated with drugs, toxins, and the
environment; and ultimately developing personalized treatment options.

2 Analytical Techniques

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The analytical tools of choice for small-molecule analysis in metabolomics are mass
spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). MS and NMR methods are both
supplementary and complementary to one another. Numerous techniques within MS and
NMR offer multifaceted approaches to detect and identify a variety of metabolites, and
measure their concentrations accurately. MS is intrinsically a highly sensitive method for
detection, quantitation, and structure elucidation of upwards of several hundred metabolites
in a single measurement. The sensitivity and accuracy of detection by MS are dependent on
the nature of the experimental conditions and the instrumental settings; major factors that
contribute include the nature of metabolite extraction, separation, ionization (and possibly
ion suppression), and detection approaches. Because of the complexity of biological
matrices, it is often necessary to separate metabolites of interest prior to MS acquisition.
Thus, hyphenated analytical techniques combining separation technology with MS have
become highly effective tools for small-molecule analysis. The main chromatography
methods that are typically coupled with MS are high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), gas chromatography (GS), and capillary electrophoresis (CE). In the last decade or
so, each of these approaches has seen tremendous growth. Such advances combined with the

development of new software packages and databases now enable quantitative analysis of
several hundreds of metabolites in automation mode.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Among the three separation methods, LC and GC methods are most widely used, while CE
is gaining increased interest in the field [7]. GC-MS achieves better metabolite separation
than LC and generally avoids ion suppression, due to its use of the gaseous phase and the
nature of its MS ionization. However, unlike LC, GC typically requires chemical
derivatization of the metabolic species prior to the GC-MS analysis [8–10]. LC-MS has seen
a major uptake in the field as it detects a larger pool of intact metabolites with no need for
chemical modification. The traditional reverse-phase chromatography is used in the
separation of nonpolar to slightly polar molecules [11] whereas HILIC (hydrophilic
interaction liquid chromatography) mode is becoming a technique of choice for strongly to
slightly polar metabolites [12].

Ionization is one of the most critical steps in MS-based metabolite measurements. The
degree of its ionization determines the ability to detect and quantify a metabolite. The most
often used ionization methods in the field of metabolomics are electrospray ionization (ESI)
and electron impact (EI) ionization. ESI is the favorite ionization technique for HPLC-MS
for multiple reasons. It adequately ionizes molecules in the liquid phase and can universally
be used for small molecules (<1,000 amu) as well as for large molecules such as peptides
and proteins. Moreover, ESI is a soft ionization technique, so it does not induce a significant
fragmentation of the molecular ions. A drawback in using ESI is that its ionization
efficiency is deleteriously affected by the presence of salts, so the chromatography methods
are limited to the use of only volatile buffers such as ammonium acetate or ammonium
formate. In addition, ion suppression can occur when co-eluting metabolites compete for a
limited number of molecular ions with low electron or proton affinity metabolites are
obscured, or not detected at all. EI is the ionization method of choice for GC-MS analysis.
EI is a hard ionization method as it causes fragmentation of metabolites and it enables
detection with minimal matrix effects due to co-eluting metabolites. Recently, atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) are
gaining traction in the field of LC-MS-based metabolic analysis [13].

Metabolite detection with high resolution and sensitivity is generally desired. However,
achieving both goals in a single MS detection mode is challenging because as a general rule
higher sensitivity leads to lower resolution and vice versa. There are various options
including single (MS) or tandem (MS/MS) mass analyzers to choose from, each of which
has different sensitivity and resolution performance. The single-configuration mass
analyzers include the quadrupole (Q), linear ion trap (LIT), quadrupole ion trap (QIT), time
of flight (TOF), Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR), and Orbitrap.
Quadrupole and ion trap analyzers offer high sensitivity, but limited resolution whereas
TOF, FTICR, and Orbitrap offer high mass resolution. Mass analyzers arranged in a tandem
configuration include triple-quadrupole ion trap (QTrap), triple quadrupole (TQ),
quadrupole-TOF (Q-TOF), and linear-quadrupole ion trap-Orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap).
Because of their high sensitivity and selectivity, TQ and Qtrap analyzers are the most
common MS spectrometers hyphenated to LC and employed in targeted metabolic studies,
while Q-TOF, LTQ-Orbitrap, and FTICR analyzers are more suitable for global profiling

and metabolite identification (including isotopomer analysis) due to their higher massresolving power. Mass analyzers used with GC are usually single quadrupoles or TOFs, but
some recent GC-MS instruments are now equipped with QTOF or TQ mass spectrometers.

3 MS-Based Metabolomics Studies
The number of MS-based metabolomics studies has increased exponentially over the last
decade (see Fig. 1). To date MS-based metabolomics approaches have been applied to study,
among others, the effect of drugs, toxins, and various diseases on metabolite levels, to trace
metabolic pathways and measure fluxes. Numerous reviews provide accounts of MS-based
metabolomics methods development and applications. For example, investigations detailing
a number of diseases including breast cancer [14], colorectal cancer [15], prostate cancer
[16], esophageal and gastric cancer [17], cardiovascular diseases [18,19], kidney diseases
[20], inborn errors of metabolism [21], effects of toxicology [22] and nutrition [23], and
metabolic fluxes [24,25] reviewed recently provide a partial account of the advances in the
field.

The metabolomics field has steadily progressed from conventional chemometrics approach
that combines global metabolite profiles and statistical methods to a more robust and reliable
quantitative approach (quantitative metabolomics). Currently, a major emphasis in the field
is being placed on the quantitative analysis of metabolites. A major benefit of the
quantitative metabolomics approach is that it potentially reduces errors arising from
numerous factors including background distortions, matrix interferences, and peak
misalignments. Quantitative metabolomics generally involves targeted tandem MS
approaches in which the combined use of precursor and product ions, along with robust
chromatography, imparts a high degree of reliability to the data. Utilization of isotopelabeled internal standards in targeted quantitative approaches enables determination of
absolute metabolite concentrations. The high costs or unavailability of isotope-labeled
standards for many compounds, however, pose a significant challenge for enhancing the
pool of quantified metabolites. An approach focused on circumventing this problem utilizes
mass production of labeled compounds in vivo through microbial metabolism [26, 27]. In
this approach, using a single uniformly 13C-labeled substrate, for example, several hundred
labeled compounds can be obtained using microorganisms such as yeast or bacteria.
Although potentially attractive, this approach involves tedious steps to make and calibrate
the labeled compounds before they can be used for quantitative applications, and challenges
exist in utilizing such extracts for studying mammalian systems. It remains to be seen if such
approaches find widespread use in metabolomics.

4 Fast MS Methods
The development of ambient ionization methods in mass spectrometry altogether bypasses
the use of chromatography separation and shows significant promise for screening
applications because such methods are fast and involve little or no sample preparation.
DESI-MS (desorption electrospray atmospheric ionization-mass spectrometry) [28], DARTMS (direct analysis in real-time-mass spectrometry) [29], and EESI-MS (extractive
electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) [30] are a few of the early methods with

demonstrated potential for real-time analysis of complex mixtures. In DESI-MS the charged
and nebulized solvent is directed towards a biological specimen, such as a tissue slice
deposited on a surface, for example. In DART-MS, a stream of excited metastable helium
gas and hot nitrogen gas are used to volatilize and ionize analytes of interest and obtain realtime metabolite data. In, EESI, two colliding spray sources are used for ionization and
introduction into the mass spectrometer. Since then the number of ambient ionization
methods have grown rapidly focusing applications to both medical and basic sciences with
more than 30 different methods available currently [31,32]. Importantly, the advent of
ambient ionization has opened avenues for in situ analysis of tissue specimens, which
promises real-time diagnostic information and accurate surgical resection of tumors [33].

5 MS Imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An important corollary of advances in ambient ionization methods is the further
development of MS imaging. MS imaging has opened new avenues for real-time tissue
characterization, in two and three dimensions, of biological specimens such as tissue
samples and promises immense utility for clinical applications and numerous other areas
[34]. High-quality images that can be obtained with high sensitivity and resolution represent
important molecular characterization tools in vivo as well as ex vivo, and promise diagnostic
applications in clinical settings. Numerous investigations demonstrate disease diagnostic
potential of MS imaging for diseases such as bladder, kidney, prostate, and brain cancers
[35–38]. Comparable performance to the current gold standard, histopathology, was shown
based on DESI-MS imaging of lipids for the diagnosis of human brain tumors, which
highlights the potential of MS imaging for guiding surgeries in real time [39].

6 Statistical Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metabolite data generated by mass spectrometry are generally complex, and hence
multivariate statistical methods are often needed to extract information from such complex
datasets. The metabolomics field has witnessed the development of a large number of
statistical methods. Of these, commonly used workhorse approaches are principal
component analysis (PCA), logistic regression, and partial least squares discriminant
analysis (PLS-DA). PCA, an unsupervised method, clusters samples without the prior
knowledge of the sample class based on the variance of the signals in the metabolite profiles
[40,41] and is often used as a starting point in the analysis. PLS-DA, a supervised method,
offers the construction of predictive models based on the regression of the data matrix (X)
against a matrix (Y) that contains class information, such as disease or healthy control, for
each sample [42]. Logistic regression analysis enables selection of the highly ranked
metabolites that contribute most to the classification. The validity of the derived statistical
models is often tested internally using leave-one-out or leave 1/3rd, 1/5th, or 1/7th out crossvalidation procedures [43]. Further, the robustness and accuracy of PLS-DA models are also
tested using Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) [44]. The most stringent test for the
validity of models is testing data from an independent sample set. Such a test is challenging
as it needs large patient cohorts, but is important to assess and eliminate the deleterious
effects of confounding factors, and develop robust statistical models.

7 Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mass spectrometry continues to play a dominant role as an important analytical tool in the
metabolomics field. Advances in the field enable discovery of numerous putative disease
biomarkers and provide insights into the pathogeneses of many diseases. Numerous findings
have also been tested for translational applications including early disease detection, therapy
prediction and prognosis, monitoring treatment, and recurrence detection [45].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

With consideration to the high complexity of biological mixtures, the vast majority of MS
analysis methods involve prior separation using LC, GC, or CE. However, the fast-growing
number of applications using continuously evolving separation methods and protocols
presents opportunities and challenges. Clearly, advances in chromatography methods
enabled efficient separation of metabolites and enhanced the number of detected
metabolites. A major challenge, however, is the inability to compare and correlate the results
of such studies on the same or similar samples obtained by independent research groups.
This is a major bottleneck to the growth of the field. Other factors such as sample
preparation, sample matrix, and carryover effects also contribute to the variability of the
data. To circumvent these challenges, there is a need to move away from the conventionally
used relative metabolite concentration measurements to more reliable absolute concentration
determinations, which will then be independent of the analytical platforms, methods, and
protocols used. This approach is not straightforward for MS, as it requires suitable internal
standards and proper calibration, but is very important. Such efforts not only enable
comparison and correlation of the vast data accumulated in the literature, but the results are
more meaningful as, ultimately, clinical translation of metabolite-based biomarker
technology requires biomarkers to be measured and validated in absolute concentration. The
evolutions in the fast MS methods that have emerged relatively more recently promise
altogether different types of applications in the biomedicine. The ambient ionization
methods used in these approaches enable real-time analysis of tissue in situ potentially under
intraoperative environments. However, unlike the chromatography-based MS methods, fast
MS methods are even more challenging to calibrate on an absolute basis. A major focus is
therefore needed to test the reproducibility of these methods for real clinical utility.
