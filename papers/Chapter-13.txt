Introduction

18

Metabolomics is a technology-driven approach whereby recent
developments in analytical tools, software, and statistical data analysis push the field forwards. Various analytical techniques have been
used, but nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are the most common analytical tools in metabolomics
research [1–14]. The high reproducibility of NMR-based techniques
and the high sensitivity and selectivity of MS-based techniques mean
that these tools are superior over other analytical techniques.
Figure 1 shows the increase in the number of both NMR-based and
MS-based metabolomics publications during the past 12 years.
Metabolomics analyses can be separated into the categories of
targeted or untargeted analysis. Untargeted analysis focuses on
the metabolic profiling of the total complement of metabolites

(“fingerprint”) in a sample. NMR is commonly used in metabolomics
fingerprinting studies. The targeted metabolomics approach
focuses on the quantification and identification of selected meta­
bolites, such as those involved in a particular metabolic pathway
or others as the direct product of drug administering or of food
intake. In targeted analysis, the metabolites under investigation
are usually known, and the preparation of samples can be adjusted
to reduce the effects of interference from associated metabolites.
An MS-based metabolomics approach is usually the optimum
method for targeted analysis.
Continuous development of MS methodology and machinery
presents a highly specific analytical tool that can provide chemical
information such as accurate mass, isotope distribution patterns for
the determination of elemental formulae, structural elucidation
though the characteristics of parent and fragment ions, identification of chemicals using spectral matching to authentic compound
data, and comparative concentration levels of different chemicals
in mixed samples. In fact, MS-based metabolomics techniques provide an exceptional combination of sensitivity and selectivity offering a powerful platform for a wide range of metabolomics research.
Compared with NMR spectroscopy, MS is superior in allowing
analysis of secondary metabolites where the detection level is of
picomole to femtomole [15, 16]. Moreover, the different MS
technologies provide an array of operational principles that can be
applied, such as different ionization techniques, so increasing the
number of metabolites that can potentially be detected.
The high reproducibility along with the nondestructive and noninvasive characteristics of NMR spectroscopy represents significant

The Strengths and Weaknesses of NMR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry

advantages for employing NMR in metabolomics research. Further,
NMR can be employed for in vivo studies, referred to as magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS); any in vitro metabolite pathway
investigated by NMR spectroscopy can be pursued by in vivo studies using MRS. An NMR-based metabolomics approach involving
isotopically labeled nuclei such as 13C and 15N can be used to obtain
useful information about the balance of metabolites in a biological
system and to monitor the flow of compounds through metabolic
pathways. The high number of metabolites that can be detected
simultaneously in a short time period of only a few minutes represents further advantage of using NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics research. For example, a single proton NMR spectrum can
quantify around 100 metabolites in a sample of human urine, this
providing a comprehensive picture of human metabolic status at a
given point in time [17]. Moreover, high-­resolution magic-angle
spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectroscopy can be used in the study of
intact tissue samples whereby metabolites present in a tissue can be
detected without the need for pre-­preparation steps such as extraction [18–24].
Finally, it is crucial to remember that there is no single analytical
platform that can perform a complete quantification and identification
of all molecules within a sample. Table 1 demonstrates the advantages
and the limitations of NMR spectroscopy compared to MS spectrometry. Thus, employing different techniques such as different ionization
methods coupled with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in
addition to one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments is necessary
to maximize the identification of different metabolites within a complex sample. For example, Wishart et al. employed different analytical
platforms such as NMR, GC-MS, direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) to identify the human urine metabolome. The results show
that a total of 209 different metabolites can be identified by NMR, in
addition to 179 by GC-MS, 127 by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 by
ICP-MS, and 10 by HPLC [25].
In this chapter, the advantages, limitations, strengths, and
weaknesses of NMR and MS as tools applicable to metabolomics
research are highlighted.

Compared with MS, NMR spectroscopy requires highly skilled
and trained manpower operators, and it is more expensive to purchase and maintain; it also demands a large space for the instrumentation (Fig. 2). Consequently, MS instruments are much more
commonly found in clinical centers and hospitals compared with
NMR spectrometers.

Chemicals

1. The chemicals most commonly used in metabolomics analyses
include HPLC grade solvents such as methanol, ethanol, chloroform, acetonitrile, and isopropanol.
2. Phosphate buffer is usually required for NMR analysis.
3. Solvents usually contain hydrogen atoms and the solvent 1H
NMR peak would overwhelm the solute 1H peaks.
Consequently, deuterated solvents should be used for NMR

measurements; those most frequently used in metabolomics
studies are D2O or (90:10 H2O: D2O) for polar metabolites
and CDCl3 for lipid samples. In the case of strong solvent
residual peaks such as (90:10 H2O: D2O), the “solvent suppression” experimental technique would be necessary to suppress the residual solvent peak.

NMR Equipment

1. NMR magnets: Even though an ultrahigh magnetic field NMR
spectrometer, such as one set at 950 MHz, will offer better
resolution and higher sensitivity, such equipment is prohibitively expensive and the maintenance is similarly costly.
Consequently, most NMR-based metabolomics studies have
been conducted using 600 and 500 MHz NMR spectrometers
that are commonly available in research institutes and offer a
good compromise between resolution, sensitivity, and cost.
2. NMR probes: Different NMR probes can be used for particular applications and for the detection of different nuclei.
Examples of commercial NMR probes that have commonly
been used in metabolomics research include:
(a) Double Resonance Broad Band Probes (BBO and BBOF)
often called Broad Band Inverse Probes. These are widely
used in experiments such as heteronuclear 2D experiments
involving single-quantum coherence (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple-­quantum correlation (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC).
(b) Triple Resonance Broad Band Probe (TBI).
TBI can be used for all BBO applications, the extra channel bringing the advantage of being able to study another
X-nucleus, so providing the capability for study of organometallic compounds and metalloproteins using 1H, 13C,
and another metal-nucleus.
(c) Double Resonance Broadband Probe (BBI). Tunable to a
wide range of frequencies; used for detection of multinuclear experiments optimized for 1H applications.
(d) Triple Resonance Broad Band Probe (TBO). TBO probe
has features similar to those of BBI probe but with one
extra channel.
(e) Triple Resonance Probe (TXI). Provides the opportunity
to pulse for up to three or four nuclei in one experiment;
used extensively for NMR structural determination of biological macromolecules.

The Strengths and Weaknesses of NMR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry

(f) Triple Resonance CryoProbe (TCI) (used mainly for protein applications but can also be used for metabolomics).
The Probe is composed of three completely independent
channels (in addition to a lock channel) that can be used
for simultaneous decoupling on multiple nuclei, such as
15
N and 13C. It is a powerful probe for multidimensional
experiments, whereby pulsing up to four nuclei in one
experiment is possible. Consequently, it is used mainly for
NMR structural determination of biological macromolecules such as proteins.
(g) MicroProbes (1 mm TXI, 1.7 mm TXI)—small volume
probes (useful for samples of a small size).
2.4

MS Equipment

1. MS components: the MS instrument consists of three major
components.
(a) Ion source: ionization part (produces gaseous ions).
(b) Analyzer: main function is to separate ions into distinctive
mass components on the basis of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z).
(c) Detector system: detects ions based on their m/z and
records relative abundance of each resolved ion.
The MS instrument also has other important components
including a system to insert samples into the ion source
and a computer to capture and analyze the data, as well as
­compare the spectra to reference MS database libraries.
There are several ionization methods including EI (electron
impact), CI (chemical ionization), MALDI (matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization), ESI (electrospray ionization),
FAB (fast-atom bombardment), SIMS (resonance ionization), PD (plasma-­desorption ionization), LIMS (laser ionization), and RIMS (resonance ionization). Application of
each of these methods brings its own advantages and limitations. Sample analysis could be carried out using different
types of analyzer such as time of flight (TOF), quadrupole,
ion trap, magnetic sector, and Fourier transform mass spectrometry. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a
detailed description of the a­ pplication, advantages, and disadvantages of each method of ionization or mass analysis.
Examples of LC-MS and GC-MS equipments that are
available in our analytical core lab are presented in the

Methods

3.1 NMR
Spectroscopy

 MR spectroscopy is a powerful analytical tool that has been used
N
mainly in chemistry for the identification and quantification of the
chemical composition of a given sample. The applications of NMR
spectroscopy are not limited to liquid samples but can also be used
on solid [26–31], gas phase [32–36], and tissue samples [28, 29,
37–49]. Moreover, as well as its main applications in molecular
identification and structural elucidation, NMR can also be used to
study the physical and chemical properties of molecules, such as
electron density and molecular dynamics [50–57]. Consequently,
NMR has become the main tool for structural biology studies as it
enables researchers to study molecular structures as well as molecular dynamics under biological conditions. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy has been employed in a wide range of research areas
including structural biology, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, physics, biology, polymers, and drug discovery
[9, 41, 58–75]. NMR spectroscopy has been proposed as one of
the most relevant methods in metabolomics applications, for
example, as powerful diagnostic method for a wide range of human
diseases [11, 14, 76–87]. Low sensitivity is the inherent disadvantage and the foremost challenge for the application of NMR in
biomedical research. Continuous developments in the relevant
machinery such as a higher magnetic field strength [88], cryogenically cooled probes [89], and microprobes [90] have significantly
enhanced the sensitivity of NMR. The dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) approach is one of the most efficient developments
[91] that has been used successfully to enhance NMR sensitivity in
imaging and spectroscopy [92–95].

The applications of NMR spectroscopy are not limited to liquid
and solid samples, but extend to intact tissue samples with use of
high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR spectroscopy. By spinning samples at an angle of 54.74°—the “magic

angle”—to the magnetic field and at high speed, spectra can be
obtained with a resolution comparable to that of solution-state
NMR spectra. Using this method, the chemical composition of tissue samples can be detected spontaneously without the need for
pre-preparation steps such as extraction [18, 96]. In an NMR-­
based metabolomics approach, this technique is helpful in offering
a correlation between the metabolic profiling of bio-fluids and the
histology of specific tissues. Consequently, HRMAS NMR spectroscopy has been used to study the metabolomic balance of small
intact tissue samples [97] including brain [98], kidney [99], liver
[100], and testicular tissues [101]. HRMAS has recently been used
in meningioma biopsies as a potential diagnostic tool for the differentiation of typical meningiomas and benign tissues [102].
Recently, Ying-Lan Zhao and coworkers have employed HRMAS
spectroscopy in conjunction with principal component analysis
(PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and
orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA) to investigate the metabolic profile of human rectal
cancer tissue collected from 127 patients and compare these with
47 samples collected from healthy control subjects [103]. The
results revealed a clear separation between the samples from
patients and those from the healthy control subjects. Several distinguishing metabolites were identified and correlated to different
stages of rectal cancer tissues, so demonstrating the possibility of
using metabolite biomarkers to follow the progression of rectal
cancer. Moreover, a total of 38 differential metabolites were successfully identified, and 16 of them were found to be closely correlated with a particular stage of rectal cancer. The results
demonstrate that, compared with healthy control samples, the
concentration levels of several metabolites including lactate, threonine, acetate, glutathione, uracil, succinate, serine, formate, lysine,
and tyrosine are found to be elevated in cancer tissue samples from
patients, whereas the levels of other metabolites such as turrine,
creatine,
betaine,
myo-inositol,
phosphocreatine,
and
­dimethylglycine are found to decrease [103].

Although NMR spectroscopy has been used in numerous multidi- 286
mensional experiments with different detectable nuclei, one-­ 287
dimensional (1D) proton (1H) NMR remains the most usable and 288
useful technique, especially for metabolomics studies. However, 289
due to the narrow range of chemical shift (10 ppm), 1H NMR 290
spectra from overlapped signals usually persist, and this leads to 291
uncertainty in the spectral assignments. Figure 3 shows the proton 292
NMR spectrum of a sample composed of two simple molecules, 293
n-propanol and n-butanol. As can be seen from the figure, the 294
signals for the methyl groups for both n-propanol and n-butanol 295
are observed at 0.92 ppm as an overlapped signal and cannot be 296

resolved by simple 1D NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, overlapping
signals were also obtained at 1.55 ppm. These overlapping signals
are related to the -CH2-groups from the two molecules, but it is
not possible to ascribe a particular signal to a particular molecule
based on the simple 1D proton NMR spectrum. Other nuclei such
as carbon and nitrogen have a wider range of NMR chemical shift
but bring other limitations. For example, one-dimensional phosphorous (31P) NMR spectroscopy has a few advantages such as the
100 % natural abundance of the 31P nuclei, a wide chemical shift
range, and high sensitivity. Thus, 31P NMR spectroscopy is commonly used to study phospholipids and metabolites involved in
energy metabolism [104, 105]. However, the fact that most
metabolites do not contain phosphorus represents the main limitation of 31P NMR spectroscopy. Generally, the spectral width of
one-dimensional carbon (13C) NMR spectra is more than 200 ppm
leading to wider spectral dispersion. 13C NMR spectroscopy is particularly informative in molecular identification and for structural
elucidation. However, the low natural abundance of the 13C nuclei
(1.1 %) as well as a low sensitivity has hindered the use of this isotope in NMR-based metabolomics applications. Different NMR
approaches have been developed to enhance the 13C NMR signals.
For example, Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer

(DEPT) is a powerful means of increasing the sensitivity of NMR
spectra whereby the 13C signal intensity can be enhanced by a factor of four. DEPT NMR experiments are also useful for distinguishing between CH2 and (CH, CH3), as the 13C NMR spectrum
of DEPT-135, for instance, yields CH2 peaks with a negative intensity and CH and CH3 peaks with a positive intensity (Fig. 4).

N NMR spectroscopy is very useful in structural biology
including the study of proteins, RNA, and DNA structure and
dynamics and also investigation of protein–metal coordination,
protein–protein, and protein–ligand interaction [106–112].
However, due mainly to the low natural abundance of 15N at only
0.37 % and a low sensitivity, this approach is expected to be less
useful in metabolomics studies.
3.1.3 Two-Dimensional
(2D) NMR Spectroscopy

Two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy can be used to overcome the problem of overlapping resonances in proton 1D NMR
spectra, leading to the detection and assignment of a greater number of metabolites than is possible with the 1D method. 2D NMR
spectroscopy is based on through space spin coupling or through
bond coupling, the former being used mainly for structural elucidation and the latter for molecular identification. Through bond
correlation, NMR spectroscopy divides into two main categories:
homonuclear, being mostly (1H–1H) such as correlation spectroscopy (COSY) [113] and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY)
[114], and heteronuclear, such as (1H–13C). Both the homonuclear

and heteronuclear categories have been used in NMR-based
metabolomics studies for signal isolation and to support the assignment of metabolites [115–119]. Other 2D methods, such as two-­
dimensional J-resolved NMR spectroscopy (J-Res) [120], and
diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) [121] have been used in
NMR-based metabolomics studies. A combination of COSY and
DOSY was employed to study metabolic changes in dystrophic
heart tissue for samples collected from a mouse model of muscular
dystrophy [122]. Heteronuclear 2D experiments involving single-­
quantum coherence (HSQC), heteronuclear multiple-quantum
correlation (HMQC), and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) have a high degree of resolution in the second
dimension mostly using (13C) and have been employed for metabolite discrimination and identification [123].
Although 2D NMR experiments improve the dispersing of
the NMR signals, increased acquisition time, data size, and complexity in data analysis limit frequent use of this approach. However,
the continuous development of NMR machinery and new faster
NMR method of signal acquisition and data processing are leading to the increased use of 2D techniques in metabolomics studies
[113, 124–126].

3.1.4 Correlation
Spectroscopy (COSY)

COSY was the first technique of 2D homonuclear correlation spectroscopy and has been used over many years for molecular identification and for structural elucidation [127–130]. COSY has been
employed in metabolomics research as it benefits from a relatively
short experimental time with the possibility of running a 2D spectrum in only a few minutes and providing far more information
than is gained from 1D NMR spectra. The simplest COSY pulse
sequence consists of a single 90° RF pulse followed by evolution
time (t1) and then a second 90° pulse followed by a measurement
period (t2). The COSY spectrum comprises a homonuclear, mostly
(1H–1H), correlation spectrum in which the cross peaks in the 2D
spectrum indicate through bond couplings between pairs of nuclei.
The cross peaks represent through bond magnetization transfer
between two nuclei. This provides a powerful tool for the identification of peaks that belong to the same molecule in samples composed of many molecules, as would be the case for metabolites in
biological samples. As through bond correlation occurs only within
the same molecule, COSY NMR spectroscopy has been used in a
wide range of NMR-based metabolomics applications [131–135].
Figure 5 shows the 2D COSY NMR spectrum from which the correlation between coupled protons can be used to assign an NMR
signal and to identify the corresponding molecule. However, for
multiple overlapped signals, 2D COSY is not powerful enough to
allow assignment of the individual signals. Other 2D NMR experiments, such as total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), can be
used to assist with signal assignment.

Total Correlation
Spectroscopy (TOCSY)

TOCSY or HOHAHA (Homonuclear Hartmann Hahn) is a similar approach to COSY, whereby the chemical shift of a given
nucleus such as H is correlated with the chemical shift of other Hs
of the same compound which are within the spin system (unbroken chain of couplings) of the atom. Similar to COSY, whereby the
correlation between pairs of atoms (protons) in nearby carbon
atoms that are connected by scalar coupling would be observed,
the TOCSY spectrum shows the cross peaks not only for protons
which are directly coupled but also for protons which are c­ onnected
by a chain of couplings. For example, if proton A is coupled with
proton B and proton B coupled with proton C, the COSY spectrum would express only the coupling A with B, whereas the
TOCSY spectrum would display the coupling of A with both B and
C. Figure 6 shows the stack plot of TOCSY (blue) and the COSY
spectrum (red): more blue peaks can be observed, these ­representing
every proton signal coupled with proton signals related to the same
molecule (n-propanol and n-butanol). This shows that TOCSY
spectrum can be used for resolving overlapped peaks that belong
to different molecules. For instance, Fig. 7 shows an extended
region of Fig. 6. Clearly, propanol peaks can be resolved from
butanol peaks by simply detecting the signals that share four crosscorrelation peaks (butanol, green arrow) compared with signals

that share only three cross peaks (propanol, black arrow).
Assignment of peaks is accomplished by drawing a projection from
the cross peak to 1D spectrum in the plot axis (Fig. 8). The arrow
projection that connects the green arrow (butanol) with the signal
at 3.584 ppm confirms that this peak refers to butanol, not propanol,
and the second projection that correlates the signal at 1.564 ppm
with the black arrow confirms that this peak corresponds to the

propanol molecule (Fig. 7). Confirmation of one peak as propanol
and another peak as butanol would be sufficient to complete the
assignment of all signals for both molecules using the TOCSY
spectrum (Fig. 8). The assignment of 1H NMR signals can be
used in combination with other 2D NMR techniques, such as heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy. This will assist in the assignment of other nuclei signals such as those of the carbon NMR
spectrum.
3.1.5 Heteronuclear
Single-Quantum
Correlation
Spectroscopy (HSQC)

Bond correlation can also be used for correlation between two different types of nuclei (commonly 1H with 13C or 15N), which are
separated by one bond. For example, the 1H–13C HSQC spectrum
coordinates the chemical shift of protons and the corresponding
bonded carbon, whereby only one cross peak will be obtained per
pair of coupled atoms. Thus, HSQC offers a particularly informative
approach for the assignment of signals, especially for the assignment
of overlapping proton signals. Figure 9 shows the 1H–13C HSQC of
a mixture of n-butanol and n-propanol spectra in CDCL3. The figure demonstrates the efficacy of HSQC in resolving overlapped proton signals. For example, the extended region (A) resolved the
overlapped proton signal at 0.91 ppm. Moreover, HSQC spectra
can be used to assign both proton and carbon NMR spectra.
HSQC is also a useful technique to reduce the experimental
time for nuclei with low sensitivity and low natural abundances,

such as 13C and 15N, whereas the magnetization from the more
sensitive nucleus I (usually 1H) transferred to the less sensitive
nucleus, such as 13C and 15N. 1H–15N HSQC spectroscopy is one
of the most important and common experimental techniques in
the assignment of protein signals, as the assignment of NMR signals is the prerequisite step for the study of protein structure and
dynamics [136–139]. Two-dimensional multiple-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HMQC) is a 2D heteronuclear correlation
NMR approach similar to HSQC spectroscopy and provides identical information with a similar spectrum but uses different methods. Both HSQC and HMQC have been used in NMR-based
metabolomics research, with HSQC being considered superior for
larger molecules such as proteins [117, 133, 140].
HMBC (Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation) is a 2D
heteronuclear correlation technique that correlates the chemical
shift of two different types of nuclei (i.e., 13C and 1H) that are separated from each other by two or more chemical bonds. The chemical shift of one nucleus, such as 1H, is usually detected in the
directly measured dimension (F2), and the chemical shift of the

700 MHz Bruker Avance (III) NMR spectrometer. The extended region (A) of the methyl group signals at
0.92 ppm indicates that this signal was resolved into two 13C signals in the second dimension, one at 10 and
the other at 13.85 ppm

other nucleus, such as 13C (X-nucleus or heteronucleus), is recorded
in the indirect dimension, as shown in Fig. 10. In this approach, a
low-pass filtration is used to eliminate the single bond correlation
known as “single-quantum coherence” corresponding with single
bond interactions. For example, (1H–13C) HMBC eliminates the
single C–H bond correlation while correlating the chemical shift of
H with C when separated by two or three bonds and, in some
cases, with even more distant ones. Thus, (1H–13C) HMBC is usually used for the assignment of signals of quaternary and carbonyl
carbons. The combination of HMBC with HSQC or HMQC provides a powerful approach for assignment of signals. Figure 11
shows both HMQC (red) and HMBC (blue), the seven red cross
peaks being associated with the seven carbons in both n-propanol
and n-butanol and the sixteen blue cross peaks being associated
with the long bond correlation interactions. This figure demonstrates the power of combining and integrating the information
from 2D NMR experiments for spectral assignment. The HMQC
spectrum can be used to distinguish an overlapped signal from a
separated one. For example, the proton multiplet signals observed
around 0.92 ppm coupled with the two carbon peaks at 10.07 and

13.79 ppm confirm that the proton NMR signal is indeed two
overlapping ones. Similarly, the proton multiplet around 1.55 ppm
is coupled with two carbon signals, while each one of the remaining proton signals at 1.37, 3.54, and 3.58 ppm is coupled with
only one carbon signal. Moreover, HMBC and HSQC spectra can
be used to separate and assign n-butanol peaks from n-propanol
ones. For instance, the carbon HSQC cross peak (red) connecting
the carbon signal at 25.67 ppm with proton resonance at 1.564 is
aligned with two HMBC cross peaks (black arrows), so assigning
the three peaks to the n-propanol molecule while the HSQC (red)
aligned with three more blue HMBC cross peaks assigns these
peaks to the n-butanol molecule (green arrows; see Fig. 12).
Figure 13 demonstrates example models of chemical bond connections of n-butanol that can be studied by using 2D experiments for
both homonuclear correlation and heteronuclear correlation.
Details of the way in which these 2D experiments can be used to
assign the proton and carbon NMR spectra of n-propanol and
n-butanol are presented and the complete proton and carbon
assignments provided in Table 2.

3.2 Mass
Spectrometry (MS)

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technique used mainly for
the identification of unknown compounds and for the quantification of known molecules within a sample [71, 141–146]. As for
NMR [28, 57, 147–152] and X-rays [153–160], it can also be
used for structural elucidation and for study of the chemical
­properties of materials under investigation [161–166]. Due to its
high sensitivity and selectivity, MS provides an important analytical
platform for profiling metabolites in mixed samples, such as biological samples. Moreover, MS can detect ions that do not contain
protons or carbon, such as metal ions. However, no MS method is
perfect for the detection of all classes of metabolites, and so more
than one method must be employed for comprehensive metabolic
profiling. Figure 14 shows the main components of the MS instrument with the different sources of ionization and types of mass
analyzer that can be used for the detection of different classes of
molecule. The advantages of using GC-MS, for example, include
high separation efficiency and reproducible retention times that
may be exchanged between different laboratories for data comparison using the retention index concept with retention time as a
marker [167]. However, the inherent limitation of GC-MS is the
fact that it detects only volatile compounds or compounds that can
be derivatized to become volatile. Furthermore, MS cannot detect
all metabolites, as some metabolites do not ionize with certain

ionization methods. The dynamic range of the MS detector is still
only three to four orders of magnitude, whereas the range of
metabolite concentration is usually much larger, and no detector
exists that can detect all metabolites. A general challenge in the
metabolic proofing of biological samples is the fact that many
metabolites have not yet been fully identified. For example, among
the 869 different metabolites that have been detected in tomato,
494 are not found in the common metabolite databases [168].
The number and class of metabolites that can be detected by
mass spectrometry depend on the choice of ionization mode. No
single ionization method can cover all metabolite classes, such as

polar, nonpolar neutral, and ionic. Consequently, different ionization
methods should be used independently to maximize the number
of metabolites detected. For example, in LC-MS analysis, electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive mode is the most common
mode that can effectively ionize a wide range of medium-sized
polar molecules, whereas the negative ionization mode is more
powerful for certain metabolite classes, such as carbohydrates and
organic acids. For example, it was reported that use of both
atmospheric-­
pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and ESI
increased the coverage of the erythrocyte metabolome by 34 %.
It has been reported that by using a set of different complementary methods of GC-MS and LC-MS up to 100–500 metabolites
can be detected in a targeted analytical approach for blood samples, and about 600–1,000 can be detected in a fingerprinting
mode [169–171]. It is important to note that the strategy for
metabolite identification in LC-MS is different from that in
GC-MS, in which usually only the molecular ion is detected and
additional MS/MS experiments are required to gain information
about the identity and structure of the metabolites.

3.2.1 Liquid
Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry (LC-MS)

LC-MS comprises two powerful analytical tools, high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, known as high-pressure liquid
chromatography) and mass spectrometry. When combined,
LC-MS represents a very powerful analytical tool for the separation, identification, and quantification of molecules in a mixed
sample. The HPLC technique separates molecules first based on
different physical and chemical properties such as molecular size,
charge, polarity, and affinity toward other molecules. As for other
chromatography techniques, HPLC consists of a stationary phase
and a mobile phase. The stationary phase involves the use of materials such as silica gel that slow down the movement of molecules
to varying extents according to molecular size, so allowing separation of molecules based on size differences. The mobile phase
comprises the solution containing the sample mixture, and this
travels through the stationary phase (chromatography column)
where separation of molecules occurs. Column chromatography
can be used to purify individual chemical compounds from mixtures. Different samples require different columns, proteins, and
peptide samples, for example, requiring different columns from
those needed for samples of small molecules typical of metabolomics studies. Once the analytes are separated, they pass through
the mass spectrometer analyzer where they are detected based on
the mass-to-charge ratio, and the intensity of each resultant line
corresponds to relative concentration of each molecule.
On the basis of its ability to separate and detect a wide range of
molecules, LC-MS is probably the most widely used mass spectrometry technology, especially in the biosciences. LC-MS is a very adaptable

The Strengths and Weaknesses of NMR Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry

tool for carrying out the majority of metabolite profiling studies,
allowing both quantitative and structural information to be obtained
with high level of sensitivity. Different separation methods can be
used to separate different classes of metabolite. For example, the
reversed-phase (RP) gradient chromatography method has been the
most commonly used separation method in LC-MS studies for global
metabolite profiling [145, 172]. However, this is not the most appropriate method for polar and/or ionic species, which includes many
important metabolites (organic acids or amino acids). These metabolites represent highly significant components in biochemical pathways, and their evaluation may be important in detecting critical
metabolic states, such as inborn errors of metabolism and metabolic
syndrome. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is an
alternative method that can be used to ionize polar metabolites, so
increasing the breadth of metabolites detected [173]. In order to
maximize the coverage of metabolites being profiled, the sample can
be analyzed twice, either using RP and HILIC separately or using a
column-switching approach of two-dimensional analysis in an
“orthogonal” combination of HILIC and RP-LC [174–177].
Although the combined use of RP and HILIC is the preferable ionization method for many metabolites, this approach does not cover
the whole range of metabolite polarities for biological samples such as
urine [145]. Consequently, other ionization methods such as positive
and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes and atmosphericpressure chemical ionization (APCI) are recommended in order to
maximize the breadth of detection of different metabolites in a biological sample [178]. Considering all these possibilities, analyses in
eight different modes (eight separate runs) are required for
­comprehensive profiling of metabolites. These combinations widen
the applications of LC-MS in metabolomics, and in fact, both targeted and nontargeted metabolomics analyses have increasingly been
conducted using different methods of LC-MS [172, 179–188].
3.2.2 Gas
Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry GC-MS

GC-MS is a novel tool for the analysis of volatile molecules, with a
high-resolution and reproducible chromatographic separations
due to the modern capillary GC, and these features render it well
suited for the analysis of complex metabolic mixtures. As for
LC-MS, GC-MS consists of two powerful analytical methods, gas
chromatography and mass spectrometry. Together, these methods
provide one of the most powerful methods of separation that can
be used to provide qualitative and quantitative information about
volatile compounds. The sample first goes through the gas chromatography unit where high-resolution separation of volatile
organic compounds in a mixture is accomplished in the gas phase.
The GC unit is composed mainly from columns, basically a tube
which generally varies in length from less than 2 m up to 60 m or
more, with a diameter ranging from 10 to 30 cm.

Different kinds of GC columns exist, such as packed and capillary
tubes, which are designed to separate different kinds of samples.
Packed tubes may be of stainless steel, glass, or fused silica and are
usually formed as coils in order that they fit into an oven for hightemperature experiments, at around 250 °C. An inert gas, such as
helium, is blown through the column; as the sample is inserted
into the column, it becomes vaporized and the volatile molecules
are pushed though the column by the helium. At the beginning, all
the molecules move together but certain of them move slower
than others, based on molecular weight and size. Smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules, and as they progress
through the column, the molecules continue to separate from each
other and eventually emerge from the column as different components, so providing an effective approach to separation.
As the molecules exit the GC column, they are introduced into
the MS unit where they are ionized using an ionization method
such as an electron beam. The ions formed from a specific molecule will depend on the nature of that molecule, and both ionized
molecules and ion fragments of the molecule are useable for distinguishing and identifying the components of a mixture at the
molecular level based on the mass-to-charge ratio. Moreover, qualitative information about the components of a mixture can be
obtained by measuring the absolute intensity of the peaks, where
the highest peak is taken to represent 100 % abundance and used
as reference for other peaks. Thus, GC-MS is the preferred analytical tool for the analysis of volatile metabolites and has been
employed in different areas of metabolomics research including
plant metabolomics and screening for inborn errors of metabolism
[189–192]. In addition to well-established databases such as the
Fiehn Metabolomics library, GC-MS provides good reproducibility and a highly reproducible fragmentation so offering a potent
tool for the identification of metabolites. Other advantages include
high sensitivity and resolution, low cost, and ease of use of instruments. The main limitation of GC-MS analysis is that it is limited
to small volatile molecules, which means that this approach is of
only limited application in global metabolic profiling studies.
Moreover, the preparation of biological samples, such as bio-fluids,
may be time-consuming and repetitive, this potentially leading to
experimental error. Other problems such as product formation and
degradation could occur during the ionization process. Moreover,
during the derivatization reaction, nonvolatile metabolites could
be converted into different forms of derivatives, leading to production of fragments, so that different forms of the same parent
metabolite exist together. While analyzing real samples such as
human urine which has a high variability in terms of metabolite
content, derivatization may occur at different rates of conversion
depending on the different properties of metabolites, so potentially

affecting reproducibility and overall results dramatically [193]. To
overcome problems such as inaccurate quantification, a standard
compound may be used for both derivatized standard compounds
and for data correction processes, such as normalization.
To generate reproducible mass spectra and highly transferable
EI-MS spectral libraries, use of standardized MS electron ionization energy of 70 eV is recommended to allow identification of
compounds through mass spectral library matching, such as NIST
and FiehnLib [194, 195].
