Emerging applications of
metabolomics in drug discovery
and precision medicine
David S. Wishart1–3

Abstract | Metabolomics is an emerging ‘omics’ science involving the comprehensive
characterization of metabolites and metabolism in biological systems. Recent advances in
metabolomics technologies are leading to a growing number of mainstream biomedical
applications. In particular, metabolomics is increasingly being used to diagnose disease,
understand disease mechanisms, identify novel drug targets, customize drug treatments and
monitor therapeutic outcomes. This Review discusses some of the latest technological
advances in metabolomics, focusing on the application of metabolomics towards uncovering
the underlying causes of complex diseases (such as atherosclerosis, cancer and diabetes), the
growing role of metabolomics in drug discovery and its potential effect on precision medicine.
Metabolic phenotyping
The characterization of a cell,
organism or biological system
using metabolomics or
metabolic profiling. Metabolic
phenotyping is a method of
describing the phenotype
using chemical or metabolite
readouts as a proxy for
an organism’s observable
biochemical traits.

Metabolites represent both the downstream output of
the genome and the upstream input from the environ­
ment. Therefore, the study of metabolites and metabo­
lism — metabolomics — allows scientists to explore the
nexus of gene–environment interactions. In contrast to
genes and genetic risk scores that can be used to indicate
what might happen, metabolic profiling and metabolic
pheno­typing indicate what is currently taking place. In this
regard, metabolomics not only enables the identification of
disease biomarkers in the form of endogenous metabolites
(gene-derived metabolites) and exogenous metabolites
(environmentally derived metabolites), it also provides
unique insights into the fundamental causes of disease1,2.
These new metabolic insights, along with the increasing
ease with which metabolomic assays can now be per­
formed, are leading to a paradigm shift in how drugs
are being discovered, developed, delivered and dosed3,4.
The growing accessibility of metabolomics is also lead­
ing to a phenomenon known as personalized metabolic
phenotyping, which, in combination with personalized
genomics, is widely expected to help advance the field of
precision medicine5. The goal of precision medicine is to
use advanced diagnostic testing to customize an indivi­
dual’s medical treatment according to their specific omic
profiles. Given that metabolomics can be used in patient
diagnosis, patient monitoring and patient omic profil­
ing 2–5, there can be little doubt that metabolomics will
play a key part in future precision medicine initiatives.
In this Review, I explore how recent developments in
metabolomics are being used to identify more-­informative
disease biomarkers, to aid the design or development of

improved treatments and to better assess health outcomes.
On a population level, these developments are helping to
advance drug discovery and development, and on an
indivi­dual level these same developments are advancing
the field of precision medicine. The key take-home
message is that metabolomics, whether it is being used in
the pharmaceutical industry or in the clinic, is becoming
a vital tool for drug discovery and therapeutics.

Metabolomics techniques and technologies
Metabolomics is a field of omics science that uses
cutting-edge analytical chemistry techniques and
advanced computational methods to characterize
complex biochemical mixtures. Metabolomics can trace
its origins to clinical chemistry, nutritional chemistry and
general metabolic biochemistry — all of which began in
the early twentieth century 6,7. Over the past 15 years,
metabolomics researchers have also coined or co‑opted
many other names to describe their field, including
metabonomics8, targeted metabolomics9, untargeted
metabolomics10, metabolic footprinting 11, metabolic
fingerprinting 12, fluxomics13, lipidomics14, metallomics15
and exposomics16. Regardless of its name, metabolomics
is finding applications in many diverse areas, including
human and animal health, biomarker discovery, drug
discovery and develop­ment, plant biology, microbiology,
food chemistry and environmental monitoring 2–16. The
diversity of applications of metabolomics arises from the
fact that it can be used to analyse a wide range of sub­
strates, including solids (such as tissues, soil and biologi­
cal waste), liquids (such as biofluids, effluent and water)

Endogenous metabolites
Metabolites that are
biosynthesized or potentially
biosynthesized by the
host organism and/or its
endogenous microflora.
Endogenous metabolites
also include xenobiotics that
have been metabolically
transformed by the host.

Exogenous metabolites
Xenobiotic metabolites or
chemicals that the host (and/or
its endogenous microflora) is
not capable of biosynthesizing
or that have not yet been
metabolically transformed.

Exposomics
A branch of omics science
that involves the study
of the complete collection of
environmental exposures
(chemicals, foods, pollutants
and pathogens) that a human
is exposed to from conception
onwards, which is referred to
as the exposome.

Coulometric array detectors
Multi-array electrochemical
detection systems for detecting
redox-active compounds
as they elute from a high
performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)
column. Chemicals or
metabolites react with
specific electrodes in the
detector depending on
their redox potential.

Inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometers
Mass spectrometers that are
specifically designed to detect
and quantify metals at very low
concentrations. Metal ions are
ionized by inductive heating
to create an electrically
conductive plasma that is then
sent to a conventional mass
spectrometer for detection.

Evaporative light-scattering
detectors
(ELSDs). Instruments that
detect compounds eluting
from a high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)
system on the basis of light
scattering rather than
ultraviolet absorption or
fluorescence. ELSDs permit
the detection of far more
compounds than other
optical techniques.

and gases (such as breath, fumes or scents). Furthermore,
metabolomics can be performed in vivo (using imaging
or live cells) or in vitro (using extracts or biofluids).
Unlike genomics, transcriptomics or proteomics, in
which a single instrument is often sufficient to perform the
necessary measurements, metabolomics requires a broad
array of instrumentation. This can include compound-­
specific instruments such as coulometric array detectors
(for detecting redox active compounds), ultraviolet
or fluorescence spectrometers (for detecting aromatic
compounds), inductively coupled mass spectrometers (for
detecting metals) and evaporative light-scattering detectors
(for detecting lipids). However, over the past 15 years,
three general purpose technologies have emerged as the
primary workhorses in metabolomics: nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy; gas chromatography
mass spectrometry (GC‑MS); and liquid chromato­graphy
MS (LC‑MS). Each technique provides broad cover­
age of many classes of organic compounds, including
lipids, amino acids, sugars, biogenic amines and organic
acids. Many comprehensive reviews have been written
regarding how each of these three technologies works
and how each can be used in metabolomics17–20. Although
these technologies each have their own advantages and
dis­advantages (TABLE 1), numerous studies have shown
how they may be used to complement each other 17–22.
Indeed, the use of multiple technologies greatly broadens
the level of metabolite coverage that can be achieved and
the types of samples that can be studied21–22.

Emerging metabolomics methods in biomedicine
Until recently, most metabolomic activities were limited
to academic institutions where the primary focus is on
research, discovery and prototype development. Under
this type of environment, sample sizes are relatively
small, protocols are diverse, student labour is cheap
and, con­s equently, there is no compelling need for
automation. Likewise, given the diversity of approaches
and the relative lack of standards, metabolomics
researchers, just as with proteomics and transcriptomics
researchers, largely eschewed the idea of absolute
quantification23–25. However, given the need for rapid
and accurate absolute quantification in clinical settings,
a recent emerging trend in metabolomics is an increased
emphasis on quantification and automation. Automation
and quantification not only increase throughput, but
they also increase reliability and reproducibility across
laboratories and among countries26. Additionally, they
are essential for eventual clinical test adoption and
regulatory approval. Indeed, this move towards auto­
mation and clinical adoption is now well underway with
LC‑MS-based metabolomics26–28.
Several exciting developments in automated, quan­
titative, NMR-based metabolomics have also recently
been described. These include both commercial prod­
ucts, such as Bruker’s food screeners for wine and fruit
juice, as well as notable efforts by several academic
labs 29,30. These new metabolomic techniques make
use of advances in NMR automation along with novel
machine learning techniques to perform automated
compound identification and quantification. As a result,

comprehensive NMR analyses can now be completed in
less than a few minutes per sample30. These develop­
ments could lead to a substantial rejuvenation in the
use of NMR in metabolomics studies. Similar advance­
ments have occurred for GC‑MS‑based metabolomics
using comparable techniques and concepts31,32. LC‑MS
is also becoming increasingly automated and far more
quantitative through the introduction of commercial kits
(produced by Biocrates Life Sciences) and ‘black-box’
systems (such as AB Sciex’s Lipidyzer). Both the LC-MS
and GC‑MS systems typically require isotopically
labelled or derivatized reference standards, automated
liquid-handling systems, strict standard operating
protocols and sophisticated software.
This shift towards kits, black-box systems, auto­mation
and greater standardization, especially in MS‑based
metabolomics, will certainly reduce costs, increase
throughput, ensure greater reproducibility and substan­
tially cut down on sample-handling errors, and it is likely
to encourage a greater focus on absolute quantification.
However, the associated simplification of metabolo­mics
may discourage methodological innovation, lead to
excessive industry and/or commercial reliance, reduce
experimental flexibility, instil a limited view of the
metabolome and encourage inexperienced researchers to
enter the field. Nevertheless, given the inexorable trends
towards automation, miniaturization and kit develop­
ment seen in so many other scientific fields, it is likely
that a similar trend will be introduced in metabolomics
in the coming years.
Another area in which exciting technological
advances in metabolomics are occurring is the field
of metabo­lite imaging. Metabolite imaging involves
the in vivo or in vitro detection and visualization of
metabolites in tissues using NMR, magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography
(PET), matrix-­assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI)-MS, secondary ion MS (SIMS) or desorption
electro­spray ionization MS (DESI-MS) techniques33,34.
MRS and PET are particularly appealing because they
permit non-invasive metabolic imaging for medical
diagnosis and metabolic phenotyping. Improvements in
NMR pulse sequences, magnetic field strength, chemical
label­ling protocols and computer processing speed are
now permitting a wider number of compounds at lower
con­centrations to be detected through MRS. In some
cases, up to 20 different metabolites can be identified
and partially quantified in certain tissues35. These
improvements are leading to far more precise diagnoses
and customized therapies. Recent advances in isotope
preparation are opening the door to PET, not only of
18
F glucose but also 11C acetate, methionine, choline and
glutamine metabolism36,37. These advances are resulting
in more-­accurate tumour phenotyping and enabling
greater customization of cancer therapies. Not to be out­
done, the field of MS imaging is now entering into a real
renaissance. The use of DESI‑MS, in conjunction with
electro-incision techniques (that is, the iKnife) is now
permitting real-time tissue-typing during surgery 38.
In particular, the gases generated from vaporized or
ionized tissue during electro-incision are vacuumed up

by the iKnife, and the mass spectrum of the ionized gas
is acquired. This DESI‑MS spectrum is compared in real
time, using sophisticated pattern recognition software,
against a database of similarly acquired DESI‑MS spectra
of diseased and healthy tissues. Using a colour-coding
scheme (with red for diseased tissue and green for healthy
tissue) automatically generated by the iKnife software
and a video monitor, surgeons can precisely character­
ize the tissues they have just cut as well as determine
where and what else needs to be cut. In many surgeries,
the visual distinction of healthy and diseased tissue is
often difficult and requires time-­consuming biopsies
and immuno­staining procedures to be performed by
histologists during surgery. By eliminating the need for
external tissue typing, the iKnife could open the door to
true real-time ‘precision surgery’.
Continuing developments in MALDI-based imaging,
such as matrix-free approaches, improved software,
faster scan rates and smaller spot sizes (<1 μm), are
leading to more-detailed images with much greater
metabolite coverage39,40. It seems likely that MS imaging
could revolutionize the field of histology the same way

that immuno-­fluorescence staining fundamentally
changed the field in the 1990s. These technological
developments in metabolite imaging and metabolomic
automation, along with other emerging techniques in
metabolomics, are having a marked effect on several
areas of bio­medicine. Not only are these advances making
metabolomics more accessible and more powerful, they
are also changing our understanding of disease, our
approach to how drugs are discovered, and our view on
how healthcare should be delivered.

New insights into disease processes
For most of the past 40 years the working assumption has
been that many chronic or serious illnesses are genetic
in origin. Very large, population-wide efforts aimed at
whole genome sequencing, transcript profiling and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characterization have
been conducted to search for disease genes or disease
SNPs41,42. Although tremendous and fundamentally
important insights into biology have been gained, the
expected genetic ‘gold mine’ has yielded far fewer disease
genes, mutations or SNPs than originally expected43,44.

Indeed, this dearth of targetable disease genes is one of
the reasons why many drug-discovery pipelines have been
drying up over the past decade45,46. More-recent epidemio­
logical surveys into the environmental causes of death and
disease47,48, along with revelations about the importance
of the microbiome49 and the epigenome50, are revealing
the effect of the environment on disease develop­ment.
Metabolomics is helping to lead this paradigm shift 1,2.
Not only has it helped us to understand cellular metab­
olism (and its major external influences) to a degree
that was not previously obtainable47,51, metabolomics
has also helped to reveal the importance of the microbi­
ome (and its major internal influences) on human health
and disease52,53. Indeed, with its unique ability to probe
complex bio­chemistry at both a cellular and an organ­
ismal level, combined with its environmental or ‘small-­
molecule centric’ view (that is, its ability to measure small
molecules from both the body and the environment),
metabolomics has already helped to identify a number of
unexpected chemical causes for several important chronic
and complex diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer
and diabetes1,47. Such studies are revealing that metabo­
lites (both exogenous and endogenous) have a far more
central role in disease development, cellular signalling and
physiological control than previously thought.

Mammalian target of
rapamycin

Case study 1 — trimethylamine N-oxide and atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is normally attributed to ‘bad
genes’ and high levels of cholesterol54. However, in a
series of articles beginning in 2011, Stanley Hazen and
colleagues used metabolomics to identify an unexpected
but compelling connection between diet, the micro­biome
and a plaque-inducing atherotoxin called trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO)55–58 (FIG. 1a). Using an untargeted metab­
olomics approach, Hazen et al. identified elevated plasma
levels of TMAO in rats that had developed athero­sclerotic
plaques. By performing targeted metabolomic studies,
they determined that TMAO is a liver by-product of
tri­methylamine (TMA). TMA, in turn, is a microbial
break­down product of carnitine, betaine and choline,
which are largely derived from meat and phospholipids
in the diet55–57. Rats injected with TMAO showed a rapid
build-up of arterial plaques, which clarified the role of
TMAO as an atherotoxin. Subsequent studies in humans
showed a strong correlation between high plasma TMAO
levels and subsequent adverse myocardial events57.
Further studies in mice also identified certain strains of
gut microorganisms that produce high levels of TMA
and other strains that produce low levels of TMA58.
More-recent studies have implicated TMAO as a mole­
cule that disrupts chol­esterol balance through modifying
the activity of flavin monooxygenase 3 (also known as
dimethylaniline monooxygenase [N-oxide-forming] 3)59.
Although the TMAO story is still evolving, it seems that
endogenously produced TMAO, in sufficiently high
levels, is probably a disease-causing metabolite.

(mTOR). A serine/threonine
kinase that acts as a master
controller of cell metabolism,
cell growth, cell
proliferation, cell survival
and protein synthesis.

Case study 2 — cancer and the discovery of oncometabo­
lites. Cancer is widely known as a genetic disease arising
from mutations in key oncogenes or tumour suppressors.
However, over the past 5 years a substantial paradigm

Microbiome
The collection of
microorganisms that reside
in or on a larger organism,
a larger organ or within a
specific environmental niche.

Epigenome
The collection of chemical
compounds that act on DNA
as well as the collection of
chemical modifications to DNA
(and histones) that direct
and/or alter the original
instructions in the genome.

Atherotoxin
An agent (specifically, a
chemical, protein or pathogen)
that damages arteries leading
to atherosclerosis or
cardiovascular disease.

Glutaminolysis
A metabolic process involving
the catabolism of glutamine
to generate energy as well
as nitrogen and carbon
byproducts. It is an
important energy pathway
for tumour cells.

shift has occurred in our understanding of this disease.
Indeed, cancer is now increasingly viewed as a metabolic
disorder 60. This has arisen, in part, through the ‘rediscov­
ery’ of two metabolic processes, aerobic glycolysis and
glutaminolysis, that are found in essentially all tumours
and are also closely linked to many known oncogenes and
tumour suppressors61. The discovery, through metabo­
lomics, of ‘oncometabolites’ has also had a substantial
effect on our understanding of cancer. Oncometabolites
are endogenous metabolites and their accumulation ini­
tiates or sustains tumour growth and metastasis. The first
oncometabolite to be discovered was 2‑hydroxyglutarate,
a natural metabolite that is found in high concentrations
in gliomas62. This compound seems to indirectly alter
histone methylation patterns, which ultimately leads to
tumorigenesis. Since the discovery of 2‑hydroxygluta­
rate, many other oncometabolites have been identified
or subsequently ‘reclassified’ (REFS 63,64) (TABLE 2). As the
causal links are being further explored, many of these
oncometabolites seem to act as signalling molecules or
allosteric regulators that control important cell division
processes65,66.
Case study 3 — amino acids and diabetes. Type 2
diabetes is a well-known metabolic disorder, but its
underlying molecular causes remain poorly understood.
A sugar-rich diet and physical inactivity can contribute
to disease development, but physically fit individuals
may also develop diabetes67 suggesting that genetics
may play a part. However, over the past 4 years, several
groups using both targeted and untargeted metabo­
lomic techniques have identified an unexpected causal
agent — amino acids. In particular, high serum levels of
branched-chain amino acids (Ile, Leu and Val), aromatic
amino acids (Phe and Tyr) and a little-known amino acid
(amino­adipic acid) can be used to identify individuals
at risk of developing type 2 diabetes68–72. Levels of these
markers are relevant up to 15 years before disease onset
and have been found to be substantially more predic­
tive than genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or
other genetic data68. High levels of these amino acids can
come from the diet, but the gut microbiome also seems
to affect the abundance of amino acids, especially essen­
tial amino acids such as Ile, Leu, Val and Phe72. It is not
widely appreciated that branched-chain amino acids are
insulin analogues. These amino acids specifically act on
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) receptor and
upregulate the same pathways and physiological pro­
cesses as insulin68,73 (FIG. 1b). If chronically high levels of
an insulin analogue are present this could eventually lead
to insulin resistance and diabetes.
Although only three examples have been high­
lighted here, the list of diseases for which their aetiology
is being ‘rewritten’ through metabolomics is growing
rapidly. Many of these diseases are now catalogued in
the Human Metabolome Database74. Among the most
interesting examples are those diseases with previously
unknown or unexplained causes, including: autism
and schizophrenia75, mild cognitive impairment or pre-­
Alzheimer disease76, as well as asthma and inflammatory
bowel disease77. Some of these metabolic links are still at

in cancer was never mentioned when Hanahan and
Weinberg first published their landmark paper on
the hallmarks of cancer in 2000 (REF. 81). However, the
weight of metabolic evidence gathered through numer­
ous studies61–64, as well as growing appreciation of the
Warburg effect in tumorigenesis82, led them to include
dysregulated metabolism as one of the hallmarks of can­
cer in their updated version of the paper 83. More recently,
the discovery of disturbed glucose and lipid metabolism
in patients with Alzheimer disease84 and pre-Alzheimer

disease76 has led to a number of new theories on the
development and aetiology of this disease. Indeed, these
findings, along with the striking similarity of experimen­
tal brain diabetes to Alzheimer disease, have led many
to consider renaming Alzheimer disease ‘type 3 diabetes’
(REF. 85). The discovery of novel metabolic connections
to diseases is also leading to the identification of novel
drug targets. For example, the identification of TMA
as a gut microbial by-product of choline and carnitine
metabolism55,56, combined with the knowledge that TMA
is the precursor to TMAO, led to the identification of two
novel protein targets — flavin monooxygenase 3 (in the
liver) and bacterial choline TMA-lyase — that could be
used to reduce TMAO levels and thereby potentially treat
or prevent atherosclerosis86.
Generally, if a metabolite or a set of metabolites is
identified as being causal, it usually means that the drug
target is an enzyme and its biosynthetic pathway is known.
For instance, with regard to TMAO and atherosclerosis,
both flavin monooxygenase 3 and choline TMA-lyase are
enzymes. Likewise, the pathway for TMA generation and
its conversion to TMAO by these two enzymes is now
well understood87,88. This makes drug discovery, synthe­
sis and testing both simple and cost effective78. Indeed,
within a few months of the TMAO discovery, Hazen
et al. were able to identify a potent inhibitor of choline
TMA-lyase called 3,3‑dimethylbutanol (a natural product
found in olive oil)55. Therefore, atherosclerosis provides
an example of how metabolomics-based drug discovery
and development may be applied to the identification and
testing of novel therapies (FIG. 2).
Many of the most-effective and best-selling drugs
are enzyme inhibitors, and thousands of metabolite-­
inspired enzyme inhibitors or antimetabolites are already
known89. Often, the discovery of a metabolic basis to a
disease leads to a simple therapeutic solution, in that if
the level of a metabolite is too high or too low its intake
may be reduced or increased, respectively. Medical
foods and dietary supplements have served as an effec­
tive solution to treat many inborn errors of metabolism,
dietary deficiency diseases (such as rickets, scurvy and
goitre) and other medical conditions such as coeliac dis­
ease (through gluten-free diets) and epilepsy (through
ketogenic diets)90–92.
Metabolomics can also play a part in reducing drug
failures that are due to toxicity in early-phase trials or
drug withdrawals in late-phase trials. Indeed, the earli­est
applications of metabolomics in the pharmaceutical
industry were in animal toxicology screens and ADMET
studies (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
and toxicity studies)93,94. Perhaps the best-known example
of these early applications is COMET (the Consortium
for Metabonomic Toxicity), which brought together five
major pharmaceutical companies along with academics
from Imperial College London to use metabolomics
as a means of creating an expert system for predicting
kidney and liver toxicity of drug-like compounds in
rodents95. Over a period of 5 years and nearly 150 stud­
ies, COMET clearly demonstrated that it was possible
to use metabolomics to provide fast, inexpensive, non-­
invasive approaches to assessing and even predicting liver

and kidney toxicity of lead compounds. Unfortunately,
despite the clear benefits and potential cost savings, these
approaches were not widely adopted by the pharma­
ceutical industry. This reluctance may be due to the
fact that the NMR-based chemometrics methods origi­
nally used were not sufficiently sensitive, quantitative or
platform-independent to permit routine or widespread
implementation94. With the recent shift in metabolomics
towards cheaper, more-automated, more-sensitive and/or
more-quantitative methods, it may be worthwhile for the
pharmaceutical industry to revisit this approach.

In addition to animal toxicity studies, metabo­lomics
can also be used in clinical trials or other settings to:
measure drug metabolites and metabolism96,97; monitor
patient compliance or adherence (detecting drug levels
or drug intake)98; assess non-compliance (detection of
alcohol or illicit drugs)99,100; track dietary compliance101;

identify optimal responders (for patient selection)107,108;
and distinguish fast-metabolizing drugs from slow-­
metabolizing drugs 3,96. An indication of the magnitude
of the problem of non-compliance or non-adherence
can be gleaned from a recent metabolomic study that
used LC-tandem MS (LC‑MS/MS) to screen for over 40
commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs or drug
metabolites in spot urines from 200 patients with hyper­
tension98. Astonishingly, it was found that 25% of the
patients were non-compliant, and patient blood pressure
levels directly correlated with the degree of medication
non-adherence. Given the considerable cost associated
with late-stage drug failures or drug withdrawals79,80,
and the potential for metabolomics to detect ‘outlier’
or non-complaint patients (who can contribute to these
failures), it is surprising that metabolomics is not used
more routinely in clinical trial monitoring. Indeed,
metabolomics can be (and has been) used in nearly every
phase of the drug development process — from target
discovery to ADMET testing, patient trials, efficacy
monitoring and dose optimization3.

Metabolomics and precision medicine
The goal of precision or personalized medicine is to
use advanced omics testing to customize an indivi­dual’s
medical treatment according to their specific bio­marker
profiles. Perhaps the most successful example of pre­
cision medicine to date has been the application of
metabolomic methods towards newborn screening 26–28.
Not only does MS‑based newborn screening help in
diagnosing or even predicting disease, but the same
techniques can also be used to determine the optimal
therapy (for example enzyme replacement or diet
restriction) and monitor or customize the therapeutic
dose. Although newborn screening technically began
well before the dawn of the metabolomics era, the
concepts and instrumentation it uses (that is, the char­
acterization of dozens of molecules simultaneously
using LC‑MS or GC‑MS methods) are essentially
identical to targeted metabolomics28. One of the main
reasons for the success and widespread adoption of
high-throughput MS‑based screening has been the very
low sample costs. Substantial cost reductions in gene
sequencing, SNP profiling and even proteomics have
opened the door to the integration of these omics tech­
nologies into precision or personalized medicine. As a
result, a number of personalized multi-omics initiatives
have begun to emerge. Of particular interest are the
efforts led by Mike Snyder on integrated personal omics
profiling (iPOP)109 and those of Leroy Hood on predict­
ive, preventive, personalized and participatory medi­
cine (P4 medicine)110. Both initiatives are longitudinal
studies in which multi-omics data (including genomic,
transcriptomic, proteomic, metagenomic and metabo­
lomic data) from hundreds to thousands of volunteers
is regularly collected over a period of years. The data are
used to assess each indivi­dual’s health status, identify
illnesses and guide medical treatment 109,110. The longterm goal of these projects is primarily to help improve
our understanding of disease, and the near-term goals
are to assess the feasibility and utility of personalized

and/or precision medicine. Both initiatives were initially
genocentric; however, they have since expanded to
include broader phenotypic or environmental meas­
ures such as meta­bolomics (meta­bolic phenotyping),
exposomics and microbiomics109–111. Interestingly, some
of the most compelling findings and most actionable
results have arisen from metabolomics or clinical
chemistry assays. These include the identification and
treatment of pre-diabetes (using glucose levels), haemo­
chromatosis (using iron levels) and dietary deficiencies
(using vitamins and other micronutrients) in several
individuals109,111.
The utility of metabolomics in these precision-­
medicine initiatives is not surprising. As noted above,
genes and genetic risk scores can be used to indicate
what might happen in terms of biochemical or cellular
functions, whereas metabolic profiling and metabolic
phenotyping indicate what is happening at a biochemical
level. With more than 190 clinically approved metabolite
biomarkers, metabolomics (through clinical chemistry)
actually offers as many biomarker options as all
other omics techniques combined112. The success of
metabolomics in biomarker translation, at least relative
to other omics techniques, seems to lie in the fact that
the underlying instrumentation (the tandem mass
spectrometer) is robust, highly quantitative, easily
adapted to new assays and already located in many clin­
ical testing laboratories112,113. Furthermore, many clinical
chemistry laboratories have the appropriately qualified
individuals, the necessary regulatory approvals and suffi­
cient knowledge to perform proper chemical biomarker
validation and translation. This pre-existing ‘chemical
biomarker infrastructure’ and a favourable cost–benefit
ratio has helped metabolomics to overcome many of
the traditional challenges facing proteomics114 and
transcriptomics115. With the continued developments in
metabolomic automation and quantification29–32, along
with software and protocol improvements to biomarker
selection and validation112, it is likely that the intrinsic
advantages of metabolomics will continue to be recog­
nized, with many more metabolite disease biomarkers
receiving clinical approval in the near future.
Another area in which metabolomics is affecting
precision medicine is drug response and monitoring.
Drug responses are often highly variable and are greatly
affected by an individual’s capacity to metabolize or uti­
lize the drug. These responses are sometimes determined
by variations in certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes
or drug target genes116. Although the field of pharmaco­
genomics, with its focus on genotyping, is now well estab­
lished, the newly emerging field of pharma­cometabolomics
is showing how metabolomics can be used to complement
this genomic information117. Because drug metabolism
and utilization involves many different enzymes, multiple
organs, several compartments and even the microbiome,
it is not always possible to screen for all possible genetic
or tissue variants. Furthermore, because drug metabo­
lism varies with ethnicity, age, gender, weight, height and
diet — as well as other physiological variables — it can
be particularly challenging to predict how an individual
will respond to a drug based on their genotype alone117,118.

However, because metabolomics allows one to measure
the sum of all these genotypic, environmental and
physio­logical effects, it can be used to directly monitor
drug responses and customize drug dosing 117.

Precision medicine and pharmacometabolomics.
Pharmacometabolomics is already yielding some excit­
ing and medically useful results with regard to drug
dosing and response measurement. For instance, in the
field of organ transplantation, rapid MS‑based monitor­
ing of immunosuppressant drugs and their metabolites
is now being used to individually optimize dosing for
patients119. More specifically, in the field of kidney trans­
plantation, quantitative LC‑MS‑based monitoring of the
immunosuppressants cyclosporine A, mycophenolic
acid, sirolimus, everolimus and tacrolimus is already
being used in the clinic to modify or optimize patient
dosing on a near-daily basis119–122. The speed, sensitivity
and robustness of MS‑based assays are also proving to
be somewhat better than traditional immunoassays119,123.
Close monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs in people
with kidney transplants is needed because of their narrow
therapeutic window and their potentially severe adverse
consequences such as leukopenia, thrombosis, anaemia
and diabetes-like symptoms119. Similar approaches are
also emerging for therapeutic drug monitoring for people
with Alzheimer disease, in whom dosage monitoring and
drug efficacy are often difficult to assess124.
In generic drug-dosage determination, metabolomic
methods can be used to measure metabolites from the
‘Pittsburgh cocktail’ (a collection of harmless drugs or
drug proxies that have specific CYP targets), thereby
allowing one to phenotype an individual’s probable drug
response before drug dosing125. Specifically, it has recently
been shown that one simple, dilute mixture consisting of
caffeine, chlorzoxazone, dapsone, debrisoquine, flurbi­
profen and mephenytoin, along with the subsequent
monitoring of these compounds and their metabolites in
human urine (using LC‑MS/MS), allows the simultaneous
activity assessment of six common drug-metabolizing
enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2E1, N‑acetyltransferase 2,
CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (REF. 126). This simple
metabolomic assay avoids the time-consuming and some­
times dangerous trial-and-error practice used by most
clinicians in individual dose determination for drugs
with a narrow therapeutic window, such as warfarin. It
has also proven useful for determining the optimal dosing
regimens for patients with existing liver conditions126.
Pharmacometabolomics is yielding important insights
into the underlying reasons behind the highly variable
patient responses to statins127, anti-­depressants128, aspi­
rin129,130 and several other drugs. In the case of statins,
some of these variations seem to arise from individ­
ual differences in the microbiome128. More specifically,
plasma values of several microbial metabolites, includ­
ing the bile acids lithocholic acid, taurolithocholic acid
and glycolithocholic acid, as well as microbially-derived
2‑hydroxyvaleric acid, were able to predict ‘good’ statin
responders from ‘poor’ statin responders. This suggests
that certain gut microbial populations, or perhaps the
response of certain classes of gut microorganisms to

statins, may pre-dispose indivi­duals towards treatment
outcomes. In contrast to statins, vari­able patient responses
to anti-depressants and aspirin seem to be due to individ­
ual variations in endogenous metabolism associated with
specific neuro­transmitter pathways128,129, or individual
perturbations in purine metabolism130. For instance, with
aspirin therapy targeted towards preventing cardiovascular
disease, higher plasma serotonin levels in patients pre- and
post-aspirin correlated with high, post-aspirin platelet
activity and platelet aggregation129. This finding was also
confirmed ex vivo, where it was shown that serotonin
increased platelet reactivity by 20% after co‑incubation
with aspirin129. Many of these discoveries could not have
been made using genotyping alone. Furthermore, the data
suggest that metabo­lomics could be used to predict good
responders from poor responders for a variety of com­
mon drugs simply by measuring serum levels of a few key
metabolites127–130. These data also suggest that metabolo­
mics could be used to adjust dosing levels to optimize an
individual’s therapeutic response119–126.
More recently, pharmacometabolomics has begun
to reap benefits from several large-scale GWAS and
metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS). These
efforts are exploring SNP-induced variations in ‘resting’
metabolite levels in urine and serum among healthy
individuals131,132. Such population-wide studies are not
only helping to explain individual variations in metabo­
lite levels, they are also highlighting how endogenous
metabolites, in combination with SNP typing, may be
used to predict or better understand an individual’s
response to a drug or therapeutic intervention132. One
particularly interesting example involved the exploration
of variations in patient responses to the antihypertensive
drug atenolol133. Patients exhibiting greater response in
terms of plasma fatty acid reduction after 9 weeks on
the drug were found to have a specific intronic SNP
(rs9652472) in their hepatic lipase gene, whereas those
with a reduced response had a specific intronic SNP
(rs7250148) in their phospholipase A2 gene. The search
for and ultimate identification of the responsible SNPs
were informed by the metabolomic data, which have
subsequently been used to rationalize known individual
and racial differences in atenolol response133.
Precision medicine, metabolomics and cancer. Person­
alized or precision medicine is perhaps most highly
developed in the field of cancer therapy. Tumour
genomic profiling is now routinely used to classify
tumour types, identify driver or germline mutations,
perform prognostic assessments and make therapeutic
decisions 134. However, the heterogeneity of cancer
genomes and cancer tissues can make it difficult to
determine the underlying causes or ascertain the optimal
treatment. Furthermore, the sheer number of mutations
and the manifold combinations of tumour suppressors
and oncogenes sometimes make individualized tumour
classification or customized therapy almost impos­
sible135. Recent developments in metabolomics, par­
ticularly in metabolite imaging, have the potential to
substantially improve current cancer treatment. As noted
earlier, many cancers exhibit a relatively small number

of distinct metabolic phenotypes61,62. Some tumours
seem to prefer aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect)136,
others depend more on glutaminolysis137, and others
still are dependent on one-carbon metabolism (which
uses choline or folate)138. Certain tumours may use a
combination of two or more of these metabolic path­
ways61,62,137. Using non-invasive methods to identify
which of the seven different ‘metabotypes ’ a given
tumour might belong to, or which oncometabolites it
is accumulating, would enable better customization
or informed adjustment of cancer therapies64. A num­
ber of impressive examples have already been reported
demonstrating the use of MRS to chemically phenotype
gliomas136,139 and the use of metabolite-informed PET
scanning (alone or in combination with MRS) to meta­
bolically phenotype a variety of other cancers36,37,136.
More specifically, MRS is being used to detect the con­
centrations of the oncometabolite 2‑hydroxyglutarate in
and around gliomas as a method to grade the severity
of and determine the probable cause of the tumour 139,
whereas the metabolite-informed PET studies are being
used to assess the differing metabolic activity or substrate
preferences of different tumour tissues36,37,136.
The use of MALDI or DESI imaging to metabolically
phenotype fixed tumour samples40 and the use of iKnife
technologies to characterize tumours in real time and
in situ38 represent equally compelling examples of the
potential of metabolomics for precision medicine in
cancer. Indeed, the iKnife has already made its transition
into the operating room as a real-time diagnostic tool
after having been extensively validated against over 80
postoperative histological assessments (in which the
match between the intra-operative iKnife diagnosis and
the postoperative histological diagnosis was 100%)38.
In summary, personalized genomics and metabo­
lo­mics could be used in each of the major phases of
precision medicine, from personal monitoring, to disease
diagnosis, to selecting the optimal therapy and adjusting
doses, and finally to tracking outcomes.

Conclusions
Relative to other omics fields, metabolomics is still a
relatively young discipline. Consequently, it is expe­
riencing many of the growing pains and false-starts

experienced at one time or another. However, over the
past decade, important advances in many key metabo­
lomics technologies and methods have occurred17–19.
Instruments and methods are faster, more sensitive,
more reliable and more automated than ever before.
Substantial informatics resources have been developed
which are permitting larger numbers of metabolites to be
identified and quantified with greater reliability 27,140,141.
Likewise, software tools and protocols for data process­
ing, data interpretation, sample handling and quality
control are becoming far more standardized, compre­
hensive and widespread27,142,143. As it is uniquely able
to perform detailed phenotypic measurements, and
because it allows scientists to explore the nexus of gene–
environment interactions, metabolomics is also gaining
increased traction through its ability to facilitate bio­
marker discovery 2,4,112. It is through these biomarker dis­
coveries and the corresponding biological insights that
metabolomics is changing our understanding of many
chronic diseases. These insights, coupled with metabolo­
mics’ unique ability to measure chemical phenotypes, are
also changing how we need to think about drug discov­
ery and development. Last, it is through the multitude of
metabolomics applications originally developed for the
drug industry that we are able to realize the benefits that
metabolomics can bring to precision medicine.
Metabolomics is changing biomedical research. The
question is: can it change health delivery? As a com­
munity, metabolomics researchers will need to become
much more translational in their thinking, focusing on
how to convert a discovery into a device, a drug or a
clinical test. In particular, simple metabolite associ­
ations will need to be proven and converted to causal
frameworks. Biomarkers will need to be validated and
moved to the clinic. Researchers must work more closely
with clinicians, and drug developers will need to work
more closely with academics. To increase their access­
ibility and popularity, metabolomics methods must
also become far more ‘kit’ oriented and metabo­lomics
instruments will have to become far simpler and cheaper.
Can this happen? Interestingly, this kind of thinking was
relatively routine in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in
the fields of analytical and clinical chemistry. Perhaps,
with a little industrial or governmental encouragement,
it could happen again.
