Abstract Accurate determination of intracellular metabolite levels requires reliable, reproducible techniques for
sampling and sample treatment. Quenching in 60% (v/v)
methanol at -40°C is currently the standard method for
sub-second arrest of metabolic activity in microbial metabolomics but there have been contradictory reports in the
literature on whether leakage of metabolites from the cells
occurs. We have re-evaluated this method in S. cerevisiae
using a comprehensive, strictly quantitative approach. By
determining the levels of a large range of metabolites in
different sample fractions and establishing mass balances
we could trace their fate during the quenching procedure
and confirm that leakage of metabolites from yeast cells
does occur during conventional cold methanol quenching,
to such an extent that the levels of most metabolites have
been previously underestimated by at least twofold. In
addition, we found that the extent of leakage depends on
the time of exposure, the temperature and the properties of
the methanol solutions. Using the mass balance approach
we could study the effect of different quenching conditions
and demonstrate that leakage can be entirely prevented by
quenching in pure methanol at B-40°C, which we propose
as a new improved method. Making use of improved data
on intracellular metabolite levels we also re-evaluated the
need of sub-second quenching of metabolic activity and of
removing the extracellular medium. Our findings have
serious implications for quantitative metabolomics-based
fields such as non-stationary 13C flux analysis, in vivo
kinetic modeling and thermodynamic network analysis.

1 Introduction
The accurate measurement of physiological levels of
intracellular metabolites is of prime interest in the study of
metabolic reaction networks and their regulation in vivo.
Owing mainly to developments in analytical tools, in particular in MS-based techniques, the field of metabolite
analysis is undergoing fast expansion. Metabolomics, the
systematic analysis of large numbers of low molecular
weight compounds from a biological system, is in the
process of establishing itself as a global analysis method
complementary to transcriptomics and proteomics and is
expected to provide major contributions to areas such as
functional genomics, toxicology and nutrigenomics. However, whether for quantitative or qualitative purposes, the
quality and reliability of metabolomics data will invariably

Leakage-free cold methanol quenching

depend on the sampling and sample treatment techniques
employed, which usually receive relatively little attention.
Strikingly, there is no consensus in the literature on the
effectiveness or even adequacy of the available techniques
for sampling, quenching and extraction of intracellular
metabolites from microbial cultures (Dekoning and Vandam 1992; Gonzalez et al. 1997; Hajjaj et al. 1998; Hans
et al. 2001; Maharjan and Ferenci 2003; Castrillo et al.
2003; Wittmann et al. 2004; Villas-Boas et al. 2005; Oldiges and Takors 2005; Schaub et al. 2006; Loret et al.
2007; Bolten et al. 2007; Villas-Boas and Bruheim 2007;
Mashego et al. 2007).
Many intermediates in metabolic reaction networks have
turnover times in the order of seconds, due to the relatively
high conversion rates and low metabolite concentrations
found in vivo. The need to rapidly quench metabolic activity
upon sampling to avoid unwanted changes in intracellular
metabolite levels was already recognized and documented
by biochemists many decades ago (Wollenberger et al.
1960; Williams et al. 1967; Veech et al. 1969; Faupel et al.
1972). In the case of cell suspension cultures rapid sampling
was initially accomplished by sampling broth directly into a
cold perchloric acid (PCA) extraction solution followed by a
series of freezing-thawing cycles, thus achieving quenching,
release of intracellular metabolites and inactivation of
enzymes (Harrison and Maitra 1969; Cole et al. 1967;
Weibel et al. 1974). However, direct extraction has two
major disadvantages: the low concentrations of metabolites
in the samples, owing to low biomass densities; and the risk
of overestimating intracellular pools, because the metabolites present in the extracellular medium are not removed.
The first significant attempt to combine quenching with cell
separation involved fast filtration and washing of the cells
with 50% (v/v) methanol at -40°C, followed by the
extraction step (Saez and Lagunas 1976). Maintaining a very
low temperature minimized metabolic activity during filtration while allowing removal of the extracellular medium.
This technique was later improved by De Koning and Van
Dam, who proposed sampling the broth directly into 60%
(v/v) methanol at -40°C and separating the cells by centrifugation (Dekoning and Vandam 1992). That was a decisive
improvement because it allowed sub-second arrest enzymatic activity. This technique has remained mostly
unchanged and is still the most widespread method for rapid
sampling of microbial cultures (Oldiges and Takors 2005;
Mashego et al. 2007).
Perhaps the most critical assumption in the cold methanol
quenching method is that intracellular metabolites will
remain inside the cells during quenching and centrifugation.
If metabolites were to leak from the cells into the methanol
solutions, which are discarded, the intracellular levels might
be severely underestimated. The original work of De Koning
and Van Dam and some of the subsequent literature

227

concluded that metabolite leakage did not occur in yeast
(Dekoning and Vandam 1992; Gonzalez et al. 1997), fungi
(Ruijter and Visser 1996; Hajjaj et al. 1998) or bacteria
(Moritz et al. 2000). However, this assumption is increasingly being questioned after some recent studies, making use
of more sensitive MS-based analytical methods, reported the
occurrence of extensive losses of intracellular metabolites
during cold methanol quenching in yeast (Villas-Boas et al.
2005) as well as bacteria (Wittmann et al. 2004; Bolten et al.
2007). Unfortunately, this issue has not been thoroughly and
systematically addressed yet. In addition, if leakage does
occur, there is no reliable, validated alternative method,
despite some recent efforts in finding substitute quenching
solutions (Villas-Boas and Bruheim 2007).
The purpose of this work was to determine quantitatively
whether leakage of intracellular metabolites occurs in
S. cerevisiae during cold methanol quenching and, if so, find
a way to prevent it. In contrast with previous method evaluation attempts, we proposed to use only strictly quantitative
data from samples obtained in standardized, reproducible
culture conditions through well-defined rapid sampling and
sample treatment procedures. In addition, a wide range of
metabolites was analyzed, to cover different classes of
compounds (phosphorylated intermediates, organic acids,
aminoacids) and different molecular properties (e.g.
molecular weight, polarity). Furthermore, after initial indications of leakage we adopted an even broader approach by
measuring metabolite levels in all possible sample fractions
and establishing mass balances to be able to trace the fate of
the metabolites during cold methanol treatment. Only such a
comprehensive approach made it possible to positively
conclude on the occurrence of leakage under different conditions and find a way to prevent it. We hope the outcomes of
this work will serve those in the metabolomics community
by providing an improved quenching method for intracellular metabolite analysis in S. cerevisiae and a standard for
method validation in other microorganisms.

2 Experimental procedures
2.1 Solvents and chemicals
HPLC-grade methanol, ethanol and chloroform were supplied by Baker (The Netherlands). Analytical grade
standards were supplied by Sigma.
2.2 Strain and cultivation conditions
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain used in this study was
CEN.PK 113-7D (MATa) (van Dijken et al. 2000). The
cells were grown in aerobic carbon-limited chemostat
cultures in a 7 l fermentor (Applikon, The Netherlands)

123

228

with a working volume of 4 l. Unless stated otherwise,
defined mineral medium (Verduyn et al. 1992) with 7.5 g/l
glucose was used, which supported a steady-state biomass
concentration of 3.7 gDW/l, the dilution rate was 0.1 h-1
and the aeration rate was 0.5 vvm (120 l/h). Dissolved
oxygen tension (DOT) was measured in situ with an oxygen probe (Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) and O2 and CO2
concentrations in the off-gas were measured at-line using a
combined paramagnetic/infrared analyzer (NGA 2000,
Rosemount, USA). The pH was controlled at 5.0 with 4 M
KOH and the temperature was set at 30°C. The overpressure in the vessel was kept at 0.3 bar and the stirrer speed
was 600 rpm, ensuring that the DO was always above 80%.
All experiments were carried out with steady-state cultures,
that is, after 5 residence times of glucose-limited growth
with constant DOT and off-gas readings.

Canelas et al.

residues were resuspended in 500 ll demineralized water
and centrifuged at 15,000g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were stored at -80°C until analysis.
2.6 Samples for quenching solution (QS) and washing
solution (WS) metabolites
Instead of discarding the methanol supernatants after quenching or washing, they were collected in pre-cooled tubes at
-40°C. Each methanol solution was thoroughly vortexed and
300–500 ll was transferred to an empty pre-cooled tube. The
exact sample weights were determined by weighing all tubes
before and after transfer and keeping record of the corresponding intracellular samples. U-13C-labeled cell extract was
added as internal standard. Boiling ethanol extraction was
performed as above to minimize the chance of sample matrix
effects and ensure inactivation of any enzyme activity.

2.3 Samples for intracellular metabolites (IC)
Samples were taken using a specialized rapid-sampling setup
(Lange et al. 2001). Unless stated otherwise, approximately
1 g (±0.05) of broth was withdrawn and injected (B0.8 s)
into a tube containing 5 ml 60% aqueous methanol (v/v)
solution pre-cooled to -40°C, the contents of the tube were
quickly mixed by vortexing (&1 s) and the tube was placed
back in the cryostat at -40°C (Lauda, Germany). This way, a
set of replicate samples can be taken quickly without
noticeably disturbing the steady-state of the culture. During
all subsequent steps the temperature of the tubes was maintained as close to -40°C as possible. The exact sample
weights were determined by weighing each tube before and
after sampling. The tubes were centrifuged using a rotor precooled to -40°C at 4,000g for 5 min in a centrifuge cooled to
-20°C. Unless stated otherwise, the biomass pellets were
washed in 5 ml 60% methanol (v/v) solution pre-cooled to
-40°C and centrifuged again as before. After decanting,
U-13C-labeled cell extract was added to the cell pellets as
internal standard (Mashego et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005).
2.4 Metabolite extraction
Extraction of intracellular metabolites was performed using
the boiling ethanol method, adapted from (Gonzalez et al.
1997) as described in (Lange et al. 2001). Briefly, each
tube was taken from the cryostat at -40°C and 5 ml 75%
(v/v) boiling ethanol was added. Each tube was immediately vortexed and placed in a water bath at 95°C. After
3 min each tube was placed back in the cryostat.

2.7 Samples for whole-broth (T) metabolites
Sampling was done as for intracellular metabolites but the
quenched cell suspension was not centrifuged. Instead, it
was thoroughly vortexed and 300–500 ll was transferred
to an empty tube pre-cooled to -40°C. The exact sample
weights were determined by weighing all tubes before and
after sampling and transfer. U-13C-labeled cell extract was
added as internal standard. Boiling ethanol extraction was
performed as above to minimize the chance of sample
matrix effects and ensure complete cell disruption and
inactivation of enzyme activity.
2.8 Samples for extracellular (EX) metabolites
Broth was quickly sampled by over-pressure into a syringe
containing an amount of cooled steel beads designed to bring
the temperature down to 0°C (Mashego et al. 2003). The
broth was then quickly filtered through a 0.45 lm cartridge
filter directly into a tube containing 5 ml 60% methanol (v/v)
at -40°C. The resulting methanol filtrate solution was
thoroughly vortexed and 300–500 ll was transferred to an
empty tube pre-cooled to -40°C. The exact sample weights
were determined by weighing all tubes before and after
sampling and transfer. U-13C-labeled cell extract was added
as internal standard. Boiling ethanol extraction was performed as above to minimize the chance of sample matrix
effects and ensure inactivation of any enzyme activity.
2.9 Metabolite analysis

2.5 Sample concentration
All ethanol extracts were evaporated under vacuum for
110 min, as described in (Mashego et al. 2004). Dried

The concentrations of the metabolic intermediates G6P,
F6P, FBP, PEP, pyruvate, T6P, 6PG, G1P, M6P, citrate,
oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, as well as

Leakage-free cold methanol quenching

the combined pool 2PG + 3PG, were determined by ESILC-MS/MS (Van Dam et al. 2002). The concentrations of
several aminoacids were determined by GC-MS using the
EZ:Faast kit for free aminoacid analysis from Phenomenex
(Torrance, CA, USA). Quantification of the metabolites
was based on the use of U-13C-labeled cell extract as
internal standard (Mashego et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2005).

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of prolonged exposure
Our initial experiments aimed at reproducing the results of
De Koning and Van Dam, who ruled out the occurrence of
leakage because measured metabolite levels did not
decrease significantly after 30 min of extra exposure to the
quenching methanol solution (Dekoning and Vandam
1992). We tested this by placing samples back in the
cryostat after re-suspension in the washing methanol
solution and leaving them at -40°C for periods of +0,
+30, +60 or +90 min prior to the second centrifugation
step. Unlike the majority of the experiments reported here,
this was done with samples from cultures at D = 0.05 h-1
and a biomass concentration of 14.5 gDW/l (Kresnowati
et al. 2006). If leakage did not occur, we would expect to
find the same intracellular levels regardless of the time of
exposure. The results are shown in Fig. 1. G6P
(MW = 260) and Fumarate (MW = 116) are given as
representative examples of the results found for phosphorylated intermediates (larger, more polar) and organic
acids (smaller, less polar), respectively. The results showed
that the longer the cells remained in contact with the
washing solution, the lower the measured intracellular

and fumarate. Prolonged exposure was achieved by leaving the
samples at -40°C before the second centrifugation step. Samples
were from a culture at D = 0.05 h-1 and 14.5 gDW/l (Kresnowati
et al. 2006). Data are averages ± standard deviation of four replicate

levels, suggesting time-dependent release of the intracellular metabolites. Interestingly, the rate of decrease was
somewhat higher for smaller compounds, which might be
released more easily, than for larger compounds. All
samples were replicates, taken, treated and analyzed as one
sample-set. Sample matrix effects in the analysis can be
discarded since U-13C-labelled extract was used as internal
standard. Then, differences can only originate from the
period of exposure to the methanol washing solution. These
results are not necessarily in contradiction with the work of
De Koning and Van Dam, since the measured losses represented not more than 30% per hour (so\15% in 30 min),
which were probably not observable with the enzymebased analytical techniques available at the time. Nevertheless, they do indicate that leakage is occurring and that
the contact time with the methanol solution should be kept
to a minimum. That is broadly in agreement with the
findings of Villas-Boas et al. (2005). What cannot be
concluded from these results is whether significant losses
occur even without prolonged exposure, since it cannot be
assumed that the rate of loss is the same throughout the
entire procedure.
3.2 Effect of buffers and ionic strength
Although the original method proposed by De Koning and
Van Dam described the use of non-buffered methanol
solutions for quenching and washing, much of the later
literature describes the use of methanol solutions with
some sort of additive, usually a buffer (Ruijter and Visser
1996; Gonzalez et al. 1997). Presumably, this would prevent or minimize cell damage caused by changes in pH or
osmotic shock. However, to our knowledge no quantitative
data has ever been presented to back up this claim. We
therefore tested the effect of adding buffers (HEPES at pH
5 or Tricine at pH 6) or salts (NH4HCO3, pH 8), at two
different concentrations (10 or 100 mM), by quenching and
washing replicate samples in each type of solution and
comparing the metabolite levels measured in the resulting
intracellular extracts. If changes in pH or low ionic strength
caused cell damage and losses of metabolites from the
cells, we would expect to see higher levels of intracellular
metabolites in samples treated with buffers or salts. The
results are shown in Fig. 2. Again, G6P and Fumarate are
given as representative examples of the results found for
phosphorylated intermediates and organic acids, respectively. The results show that there is no significant benefit
in buffering or increasing the ionic strength of the methanol
solution. On the contrary, for most metabolites this resulted
in slightly lower intracellular amounts. In addition, this
effect was more pronounced for smaller compounds, which
might be released more easily, than for larger compounds.
All samples were replicates and U-13C-labelled extract was

Fig. 2 Effect of additions (HEPES at pH 5, Tricine at pH 6 or
NH4HCO3 at pH 8, to 10 or 100 mM) to the methanol quenching/
washing solutions (60% v/v) on the measured intracellular levels,
exemplified for G6P and fumarate. Samples were from a culture at
D = 0.1 h-1 and 3.7 gDW/l. Data are averages ± standard deviation
of two replicate samples, each analyzed in duplicate

used as internal standard, so the differences must originate
from the quenching and washing steps. These results suggest that losses can occur during quenching/washing, since
changing the properties of the methanol solutions can
affect the levels found in the cell pellets. Furthermore, they
showed that if losses are occurring, they cannot be prevented by adding buffers or salts to the methanol solutions.
On the contrary, such additions may even enhance the
extent of the losses.
3.3 Effect of methanol concentration
Methanol is widely regarded as a toxic compound that can
have detrimental effects on cell membrane integrity. A
methanol concentration of 60% (v/v), as proposed by De
Koning and Van Dam, is just enough to keep the cell
suspension after sampling (50% v/v final, FP & -42°C1)
from freezing at -40°C. This seems to reflect the perceived
need to keep the methanol concentration as low as possible,
for fear of causing damage to the cells. We are not aware of
subsequent literature where this has been changed. However, to our knowledge no quantitative data has ever been
presented to demonstrate the adverse effects of methanol in
the context of quenching and intracellular metabolite
analysis. We therefore evaluated the effect of the methanol
concentration by quenching and washing replicate samples
in 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% methanol and comparing the
metabolite levels measured in the resulting intracellular
extracts. To avoid freezing of the samples quenched with
50% (v/v) solutions (42% v/v final, FP & -32°C (see
footnote 1)), in this experiment the cryostat temperature
was -30°C instead of -40°C. If increasing methanol

sixth order polynomial

concentrations caused cell membrane damage and this
allowed release of intracellular metabolites, we would
expect to find higher metabolite levels in samples treated
with lower methanol concentrations. The results are shown
in Fig. 3. Once again, G6P and Fumarate are given as
representative examples of the results found for phosphorylated intermediates and organic acids, respectively.
Contrary to our expectations, in samples obtained by
quenching and washing with higher methanol concentrations the intracellular metabolites levels were higher. In
addition, the differences followed a clear, smooth profile as
function of increasing methanol concentration. All samples
were replicates and U-13C-labelled extract was used as
internal standard, so the differences must originate from the
quenching and washing steps. Like before, the fact that
changing the properties of the methanol solutions could
affect the obtained intracellular levels of metabolites suggested that losses can occur during quenching/washing.
More importantly, the results unexpectedly show that under
these conditions higher concentrations of methanol may
reduce those losses, rather than increase them.
3.4 Full mass balance and the importance of methanol
concentration and temperature
Although useful information can be obtained by analyzing
only the intracellular samples, as presented above, these
provide merely indications. To draw definitive conclusions
on the occurrence and the extent of leakage it is necessary
to analyze metabolite levels in all the other sample fractions and perform mass balances. Only then can the fate of
the metabolites during sample treatment be adequately
evaluated. To achieve this, we have analyzed metabolite
amounts in six different fractions (see Fig. 4), representing

Fig. 3 Effect of the methanol (MeOH) concentration of the quenching/washing solutions on the measured intracellular levels,
exemplified for G6P and fumarate. To avoid freezing of the samples
quenched with 50% methanol the cryostat temperature was -30°C
instead of -40°C. Samples were from a culture at D = 0.1 h-1 and
3.7 gDW/l. Data are averages ± standard deviation of two replicate
samples, each analyzed in duplicate

of the metabolites during
sample treatment (see Methods
for details). The temperature

the quenching/washing
solutions was varied according
to Table 1

be used as a benchmark, with which the levels measured in
the methanol-quenched intracellular samples (IC) can be
compared. Detailed data on these values, for each measured metabolite, is provided in Table 2. The IC/(T - EX)
ratio, which is a measure of how close each protocol variation comes to delivering to ‘‘true’’ intracellular levels, is
represented in Fig. 6.
The results show that leakage of intracellular metabolites does occur in the standard procedure of quenching in
60% methanol at -40°C (Fig. 5), regardless of whether a
washing step is carried out (C) or not (D). The measured
intracellular levels are lower than the calculated cell levels
(T - EX) and the differences can be found back in the
methanol solutions. In the samples that were processed at
-20°C instead of -40°C, leakage was much more severe
(A and B). Increasing the final concentration of methanol
from 50% to around 90% was found to minimize leakage
(D–G). At final methanol concentrations above 80% (F and
G) most measured intracellular levels are within ±20% of
the estimated cell levels (Fig. 6). Further decreasing the
temperature to -78°C did not result in any significant
further improvement (H). In addition, leakage was most
critical for smaller metabolites, which may permeate

washed and non-washed intracellular samples (IC), the
respective quenching and washing methanol solutions (QS
and WS), the medium filtrate (EX) and the whole-broth
(T). The actual metabolite levels in the cells were estimated
by the so-called ‘‘differential method’’ by subtracting the
amount in the extracellular medium from the whole-broth
total (T - EX). Furthermore, we analyzed all fractions for
eight variations of the cold methanol quenching protocol,
as described in Table 1, to investigate the effects of
methanol concentration and temperature. These samples
were analyzed not only for phosphorylated intermediates
and organic acids but also for aminoacids, providing an
even wider range of compounds. All metabolite levels were
expressed in lmol/gDW, to establish the mass balances. The
mass balance results are shown in Fig. 5. G6P and Fumarate are given as representative examples of the results
found for phosphorylated intermediates and organic acids
and Glutamate (MW = 147) as a representative of midmolecular weight aminoacids. Average mass balance closure over all measured metabolites (calculated as
(IC + QS)/T) was 105% (±36%), which is quite satisfactory considering the analytical challenge involved. The cell
levels calculated by the differential method (T - EX) can

Fig. 5 Full mass balance of the metabolite levels measured in the
different sample fractions (see Fig. 4) under eight different variations
in sample treatment protocol (see Table 1), exemplified for G6P,
glutamate and fumarate. The metabolite levels inside the cells were

estimated from the difference of the concentrations in whole-broth
and extracellular medium (T - EX). Samples were from cultures at
D = 0.1 h-1 and 3.7 gDW/l. Data are averages ± standard deviation
of at least two replicate samples, each analyzed at least in duplicate

through the cell membrane more easily, while bulkier,
more polar metabolites seemed to leak less. These results
show that the standard protocol of quenching in 60%
methanol at -40°C leads to considerable underestimation
of the intracellular levels of most metabolites. The results
also highlight the importance of the temperature and the
methanol concentration, two factors that were not fully
explored before, in obtaining accurate data. Special care

should be taken to ensure that the temperature is not significantly above -40°C throughout the sample treatment,
since even at -20°C leakage may become much more
severe. Furthermore, the results confirm that at least in the
context of quenching, methanol seems to act as a cryopreservant rather than as an extractant and that increasing
its final concentration to above 80% can effectively prevent
losses of metabolites from the cells. These conclusions

could not have been drawn and the quenching method
could not have been reliably optimized without a comprehensive, fully quantitative approach.
The occurrence of leakage in S. cerevisiae has also been
reported by Villas-Boas et al. from measurements of
metabolites in cell pellets, quenching solutions and filtrates
(Villas-Boas et al. 2005). In contrast, other studies have
dismissed leakage mainly or exclusively because metabolite levels in methanol supernatants were below detection
or considered negligible (Dekoning and Vandam 1992;
Hans et al. 2001; Castrillo et al. 2003; Loret et al. 2007).
Hans et al. actually found much higher levels of intracellular aminoacids after sampling into cold water (4°C) than
after cold methanol quenching, which is a rather strong
indication of leakage, but a mass balance was not performed (Hans et al. 2001). To our knowledge, Gonzalez
et al. were the only ones to report a mass balance (for four
metabolites: G6P, ATP, NAD and NADH) including the
measurement of metabolites in whole-broth to investigate
leakage in S. cerevisiae (Gonzalez et al. 1997). They
found that metabolite levels in methanol-quenched pellets
were lower than in the whole-broth, particularly for G6P
and NAD. However, the difference could be accounted for
by the noticeably high amounts found extracellularly,
which represented 45% of the total whole-broth G6P and
30% of NAD.
It should also be noted that all previous studies which in
some way or another investigated the occurrence of leakage in S. cerevisiae were carried out with shake-flask

Leakage-free cold methanol quenching

cultures. Instead, the experiments described in this study
were performed in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures. The obvious advantage of chemostat cultures is that
they are more reproducible (Hoskisson and Hobbs 2005).
In addition, while in batch cultures the time of sampling is
critical because metabolite levels are highly dynamic (Hans
et al. 2001; Weibel et al. 1974), in steady-state chemostat
cultures metabolite levels change much more slowly or not
at all (Wu et al. 2006; Mashego et al. 2005). Furthermore,
a larger fermenter volume and the use of rapid-sampling
equipment mean that a large number of replicate samples
can be obtained within a very short period of time and
processed together, further improving data consistency and
reproducibility. The differences in growth conditions and
sampling, as well as differences between S. cerevisiae
strains and medium composition are likely to affect the
biomass composition and sample properties, which in turn
could affect the extent of metabolite leakage. This might
explain, at least partly, some of the differences in results.
Our results show that the extent of metabolite leakage
depends on the temperature during treatment and the
properties of the quenching/washing solutions, namely the
methanol concentration and the ionic strength. Throughout
all experiments, including tryouts not shown here, the same
trends were consistent and reproducible. To our knowledge, none of these factors had been quantitatively
investigated before. One possible explanation for the effect
of the methanol concentration might be that it decreases the
freezing point (FP). The larger the difference between the
processing temperature and the freezing point, the lower
the chance that part of the sample freezes, causing cell
lysis. However, we found that losses by quenching with
40% methanol (33% v/v final, FP & -23°C (see footnote
1)) and 60% methanol (50% v/v final, FP & -42°C (see
footnote 1)) at -20°C were higher than with 60% methanol
(50% v/v final, FP & -42°C (see footnote 1)) and 80%
methanol (50% v/v final, FP & -72°C (see footnote 1)) at
-40°C, respectively (Fig. 5A vs. D and B vs. E). Therefore, metabolite leakage depended both on temperature
(Fig. 5B vs. D) and methanol concentration (Fig. 5D vs.
E), but not on the difference between temperature and
freezing point. In addition, if leakage occurred by cell lysis
we would expect to find metabolites levels in the quenching/washing solutions in proportion to their levels inside
the cells, which was not the case. What changes in methanol concentration, temperature and ionic strength have in
common is that they can affect the solubility and diffusivity
of metabolites. Methanol is a fairly polar solvent but it is
by far not as good a solvent as water for hydrophilic
compounds, so the higher its concentration the lower the
solubility of most intracellular metabolites. On the other
hand, increasing the ionic strength of a concentrated
methanol solution may improve the solubility of polar

235

compounds by allowing more ion-ion interactions. In
addition, the solubility and diffusion coefficients usually
increase with the temperature. In view of these considerations, we would expect higher methanol concentrations
and lower temperatures and lower ionic strengths to reduce
the solubility and diffusion rate of polar compounds, which
is in agreement with the observed effects in terms of
metabolite leakage from the cells. This is also in agreement
with the fact that smaller metabolites were found to leak
more than larger ones, as illustrated in Fig. 7, since smaller
metabolites are expected to have higher diffusivities.
Although increasing the methanol concentration could
effectively prevent leakage of intracellular metabolites, this
can also have one important disadvantage. We found that
samples quenched and washed in solutions with higher
methanol content contained much higher levels of phosphate
and sulfate. Both are abundant in the medium used for the
cultures (22 mM phosphate and 40 mM sulfate) and apparently were carried over in the samples, indicating that the
washing efficiency was significantly decreased. While leakage can lead to underestimation of intracellular levels,
insufficient washing can lead to overestimation. Extracellular
components not adequately eliminated can also potentially
interfere with certain analytical techniques (e.g. ion-suppression in MS-based analysis). Our results indicate that the
intracellular levels were not overestimated even in samples
quenched in pure methanol, since the measured IC levels were
not consistently higher than the calculated cell levels
(T - EX) (Fig. 6F–H). However, in other culture conditions

size) and the extent of leakage under the conventional cold methanol

123

236

where extracellular concentrations are higher (e.g. batch,
anaerobic conditions) this may need to be confirmed.
3.5 The importance of quenching metabolism,
removing the extracellular medium and avoiding
leakage
Although the need to stop metabolic activity upon sampling
for intracellular metabolite analysis has been well documented for decades it is still possible to find studies being
published which report intracellular metabolite measurements
from samples obtained without any apparent concern for
quenching. The turnover time, which is the ratio between the
metabolite concentration and the flux through that pool, is a
good criteria to evaluate the need for quenching. Since our
results show that intracellular metabolite levels have been
significantly underestimated due to leakage, we have re-calculated the turnover times based on our best estimate of the
intracellular levels. These were obtained as the averages of the
levels found with quenching in pure methanol (columns F, G
and H of Table 2), where leakage was prevented (Fig. 6). As
shown in Table 3, most intermediates in central metabolism
have short turnover times, particularly those that are highly
connected (Pyruvate) or that have relatively low pools (FBP,
fumarate). In this regard it is worth mentioning that cofactors
such as ATP, ADP, NAD and NADH, which are involved in
large numbers of reactions, are likely to have even shorter
turnover times. On the other hand, most aminoacids have
much longer turnover times, owing to proportionally small
fluxes and large pools. In view of these results we can conclude that sub-second quenching of metabolic activity is
necessary for reliable analysis of intracellular levels of intermediates in central metabolism, while slower sampling
methods such as filtration (Bolten et al. 2007) may also
acceptable for analysis of aminoacid levels.
As mentioned before, the main reason to use cold methanol quenching is that it allows removal of metabolites
present in the extracellular medium. This is necessary if a
significant fraction of the metabolites is present outside the
cells. It may also be desirable in cases where medium components can interfere with analytical techniques (e.g. high
salt concentrations can cause peak-shifting in ion-exchange
LC and ion-supression in MS). If separation was not necessary, whole-broth extraction might be a simpler and faster
alternative. Since we analyzed metabolite levels in all sample fractions, we can re-check the need to separate the
extracellular medium by calculating the extracellular fraction for each metabolite (=EX/T). It should be kept in mind
that a large extracellular fraction does not necessarily mean
that the extracellular concentration is high. The reason for
this is that the extracellular volume is typically 100–1,000fold higher than the intracellular volume so even very low
extracellular concentrations can represent a large fraction of

123

Canelas et al.

the total whole-broth amount (see Fig. 5). As shown in
Table 3, several metabolites have rather high extracellular
fractions, particularly organic acids and aminoacids with
non-polar side chains. Accurate analysis of the intracellular
levels of these metabolites therefore requires adequate separation of the extracellular medium, while methods
involving whole-broth extraction may be acceptable for
analysis of compounds such as the phosphorylated intermediates, which are mostly present inside the cells. Note that
these results were obtained in carbon-limited cultures and
that extracellular fractions are most likely higher in carbonexcess conditions (Bolten et al. 2007).
One possibility to differentiate between intracellular and
extracellular metabolites is the ‘‘differential method’’,
which we used above as benchmark for the improvement of
the cold methanol quenching protocol. The major disadvantage of the differential method is the propagation of
error associated with the subtraction, especially because
metabolite levels in the filtrate are very dilute and difficult
to assay reliably. This problem is further amplified if the
extracellular fraction is large (two large numbers being
subtracted to obtain a small number). The only way to try
to minimize the uncertainty is through ‘‘brute force’’, by
increasing the number of replicate samples (note that the
uncertainties in Table 2 are standard errors, not standard
deviations), but in practice this is sometimes not possible
(e.g. investigation of short-term dynamics) and it is not
guaranteed to succeed. The differential method is also not
an alternative in the cases where medium components
interfere with the analytical procedures.
It follows that the most desirable is to have a sampling
method that ensures sub-second quenching of metabolism
while allowing separation of the extracellular medium, which
explains the popularity of the cold methanol method. Methanol is the most obvious choice of solvent because it is fully
miscible with water (in contrast with more apolar solvents) but
has a very low freezing-point (much lower than ethanol,
propanol or glycerol, for example). In addition, methanol is
thought to be less harmful to the cells than other organic
compounds and methanol-water solutions are not very viscous, which allows easy centrifugation and cell separation.
However, cold methanol quenching can only be used if
leakage of intracellular metabolites does not occur. Much of
the work reported here aimed at quantifying the extent of
leakage and trying to prevent it. As shown in Table 3, the
extent of leakage in the conventional cold methanol quenching method (60%, -40°C) is such that most metabolites
investigated would be underestimated by more than twofold.
With the exception of only the largest, most polar metabolites
(FBP, T6P and probably others such as nucleotides), accurate
analysis of the intracellular metabolite levels in S. cerevisiae
is only possible using the improved cold methanol quenching
method described here.

Best estimates of the intracellular levels are the averages of levels obtained by quenching in pure methanol (average of columns F, G and H of
Table 2). Net fluxes through metabolite pools were calculated from the estimated steady-state intracellular flux distribution under aerobic
glucose-limited conditions according to (Daran-Lapujade et al. 2004). The turnover time is the ratio between the intracellular level and the flux.
The extracellular fraction is the ratio between the levels measured in the extracellular (EX) and total broth (T) samples. The loss factor due to
leakage is the ratio between the best estimate of the intracellular level (in the second column) and the level found by conventional cold methanol
quenching (column C of Table 2). Metabolites are in order of increasing molecular weight
–, Metabolites not present in the stoichiometric model (Daran-Lapujade et al. 2004) under aerobic glucose-limited conditions

These findings have obvious implications for metabolomics-based research in S. cerevisiae, such as nonstationary 13C flux analysis, in vivo kinetic modeling and
thermodynamic network analysis, which all rely on the
accuracy of intracellular metabolite determination.

4 Concluding remarks and recommendations
For accurate determination of intracellular metabolites in
S. cerevisiae broth should be harvested into pure methanol
at B-40°C with a sample/quenching solution ratio of 1:5

123

or lower (final methanol concentration C83%). Preferably,
this should be done using rapid sampling equipment to
avoid changes in metabolite concentrations during harvesting, especially from chemostat cultures and if shortturnover metabolites are to be measured. Centrifugation
should be done quickly (B5 min at C4,000g) and using a
pre-cooled rotor, to keep the temperature below or around
-40°C. The overall time of exposure to methanol should
be kept to a minimum. If a washing step is strictly necessary, to minimize the concentration of contaminants from
the extracellular medium, this should be done with C83%
methanol.
Sample treatment techniques should be validated quantitatively for each microorganism and growth condition.
Not doing so compromises the conclusions drawn from
subsequent research.
