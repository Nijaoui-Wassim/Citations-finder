Accurate determination of intracellular metabolite levels
requires well-validated procedures for sampling and
sample treatment. Several methods exist for metabolite
extraction, but the literature is contradictory regarding the
adequacy and performance of each technique. Using a
strictly quantitative approach, we have re-evaluated five
methods (hot water, HW; boiling ethanol, BE; chloroformmethanol, CM; freezing-thawing in methanol, FTM; acidic
acetonitrile-methanol, AANM) for the extraction of 44
intracellular metabolites (phosphorylated intermediates,
amino acids, organic acids, nucleotides) from S. cerevisiae cells. Two culture modes were investigated (batch and
chemostat) to check for growth condition dependency, and
three targeted platforms were employed (two LC-MS
and one GC/MS) to exclude analytical bias. Additionally,
for the determination of metabolite recoveries, we applied
a novel approach based on addition of 13C-labeled internal standards at different stages of sample processing.
We found that the choice of extraction method can
drastically affect measured metabolite levels, to an
extent that for some metabolites even the direction of
changes between growth conditions can be inverted.
The best performances, in terms of efficacy and metabolite recoveries, were achieved with BE and CM,
which yielded nearly identical levels for the metabolites
analyzed. According to our results, AANM performs
poorly in yeast and FTM cannot be considered adequate as an extraction method, as it does not ensure
inactivation of enzymatic activity.
The ability to accurately determine intracellular concentrations
of metabolites is of key importance in studying signaling and
metabolic reaction networks and their regulation in vivo. With
the dawn of the metabolomics era, mainly fueled by the development of sensitive high-throughput MS-based analytics, metabolome-wide analysis is set to become reality. However, despite half
a century of experience in the measurement of intracellular
metabolites, the procedures used for preparation of the biological
samples remain an issue.1-5 It is increasingly recognized that,
whether for semiquantitative or for quantitative purposes, the
accuracy and reliability of the results are to a large extent

determined by the first steps of sample treatment, namely rapid
sampling, quenching of metabolic activity, separation of extracellular medium (when applicable), and metabolite extraction. We
have recently addressed the problem of metabolite leakage from
yeast cells during cold methanol quenching.1 Here, we approach
the main issues regarding the performance of extraction methodologies for microbial metabolomics, with a focus on S. cerevisiae.
There are three essential requirements that an ideal metabolite
extraction method must fulfill:6,7 (i) completeness of extraction,
to ensure all intracellular pools are made entirely accessible for
analysis, (ii) prevention of metabolite conversion during the
extraction or subsequent steps, mainly by ensuring effective
inactivation of enzymes, and (iii) absence of extensive degradation
of metabolites by the procedure itself. With respect to this last
requirement, partial losses may be acceptable if the results can
be corrected by means of metabolite-specific recovery factors6,7
or through the use of adequate internal standards (e.g., isotope
based).8-10 Theoretically, completeness of extraction cannot be
directly verified, since one does not know a priori how much of
each metabolite is initially present in the cells. Instead, completeness can be evaluated by comparing the ability of different
methods to release metabolites from identical biological samples,
which we shall refer to as efficacy. The absence of enzyme activity
and the extent of metabolite degradation can both be tested by
determining metabolite recoveries, traditionally by means of
spiking or standard additions. Metabolite-specific recoveries much
below 100% typically indicate degradation, while mixed recoveries
above and below 100% for different metabolites would indicate
interconversion.
Extraction can be achieved using high temperature, extreme
pH, organic solvents, mechanical stress, or combinations of these.

Some of the most well-known extraction methods, such as
perchloric acid (PCA),11,12 hot water (HW),13,14 and boiling ethanol
(BE),15,16 have been employed at least since the 1950s. Eventually,
the perceived need to adopt less aggressive procedures to prevent
metabolite degradation seems to have steered researchers into
the development of milder extraction methods. In the 1990s, a
neutral low-temperature technique based on a two-phase liquid
extraction with chloroform-methanol (CM) was introduced,6
presumably adapted from a method for lipid extraction from
tissues.17 More recently, two other methods have been proposed,
one based on freezing-thawing cycles in methanol (FTM),18
another using acidic acetonitrile-methanol (AANM).19
Given the variety of extraction methods available, how does
one decide which method to use? To demonstrate the complexity
of this choice, we have assembled a complete (to the best of our
knowledge) survey of method comparisons in the literature, which
we present in Table 1. As this overview shows, each of the
methods is considered very good, or best, by some studies and
poor, or inadequate, by others (with the exception of AANM which
was evaluated only once). Since method comparisons have been
performed in different species, when comparing them, one should
keep in mind that some aspects of extraction performance can
be organism dependent. In particular, completeness of extraction
may be microbe specific, since some types of cells are more
susceptible to lysis than others (e.g., eukaryotes vs prokaryotes,
gram-positive vs gram-negative). Enzyme resistance to inactivation
may also be organism dependent; although among mesophile
species, one would expect it to be comparable. As for metabolite
stability, it should be nearly independent of the type of cell
extracted. Although these factors must be considered, they seem
unlikely to change the performance of a particular method from
bad to best, nor can they explain the discrepancies found within
the same or closely related species. Another observation from the
overview in Table 1 is the prominence of mild extractions in recent
literature. Five out of the last eight studies consider FTM the best
extraction method. Although cold methanol is known to release
intracellular metabolites,1,5,20 it is less clear whether enzyme
activity can be effectively inactivated, especially if one considers
that enzyme activities can be assayed at temperatures below 0 °C
in 70% methanol.21,22 Furthermore, of the 15 studies examined, 5
did not determine metabolite recoveries, without which it is not
possible to check for metabolite conversion or degradation, and
8 investigated only 2-3 extraction methods, which limits the
conclusions that can be drawn in terms of efficacy. In addition,
all but 3 studies examined relatively small sets of compounds of
very similar molecular properties. Finally, 5 of the last 8 studies
based their evaluation on qualitative or semiquantitative measures.
Qualitative measures (e.g., number of GC peaks) bear little or no
information on the fulfillment of the essential requirements, while
the use of semiquantitative measures (e.g., peak area or height,

valid for MS-based analysis of complex samples such as cell
extracts.10

the techniques in Table 1 only acid (PCA) and base (KOH)
extractions were not included, because their salt-rich extracts
present limitations for our analytical platform (e.g., ion suppression). These methods have also seen relatively little use in recent
years, due to reported near-total losses of specific coenzymes.7,24,25
We have based our evaluation only on strictly quantitative data of
metabolite concentrations in cell extracts. Samples were obtained
under well-defined, reproducible culture conditions using optimized sampling procedures. Two different growth states were
investigated (glucose limitation and excess), to check for growth
condition dependency. Three analytical methods (GC/MS and two
LC-MS/MS) were employed, to exclude analytical bias, covering
a total of 44 metabolites of different classes and molecular
properties (phosphorylated intermediates, organic acids, amino
acids, nucleotides). For the determination of metabolite recoveries,
we introduced and applied a novel approach based on differential
addition of 13C-labeled internal standards at the beginning and
end of the sample treatment.
We are confident that the outcomes of this work will serve
researchers in the microbial metabolomics community by providing an improved assessment of the extraction techniques at their
disposal. The experimental strategy employed, including the new
13
C-based approach for determining recoveries, should also be
useful as a framework for systematic validation of these, and
newer methods, in other microorganisms.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Solvents and Chemicals. HPLC-grade solvents were from
J.T. Baker. Analytical grade standards were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Strain and Medium. The strain used was the prototrophic
haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-7D (MATa).26 Strain
stocks were kept in 20% glycerol at -80 °C. A new low-salt minimal
medium was designed, for sustaining a biomass concentration of
1.5-4.5 gDW/L. Ensuring low residual concentrations of salts
minimizes interferences in the analysis (e.g., peak-shifting, ion
suppression) by ions carried over in samples, in case of limited
washing.1 No change in morphology or physiology has been
observed in the cells compared to growth on standard saltrich medium.27,28 The composition of the optimized medium was,
per liter: 0.3 g of (NH4)2SO4, 3 g of NH4H2PO4, 0.3 g of KH2PO4,
0.5 g of MgSO4 · 7H2O, 1 g of vitamin solution,29 and 1 g of
trace element solution.28 As carbon source, the medium
contained 7.5 g/L glucose, and as antifoam, it contained 0.05
g/L silicone antifoaming agent (BDH, U.K.). The final pH was
adjusted to 5 with KOH.
Cultivation Conditions. Cultivations were performed aerobically in a 7 L fermentor (Applikon, The Netherlands) equipped
with a DCU3 controller and continuous data acquisition via MFCS
(B. Braun Biotech, Germany). A working volume of 4 L was
maintained by weight control. The cultivations were carried out
at 30 °C, pH 5.0 (via addition of 2 M KOH), with 0.3 bar
overpressure, an aeration rate of 0.5 vvm (120 L/h), and a stirrer
speed of 500 rpm. Base utilization and effluent accumulation were
monitored by weight. Oxygen and CO2 fractions in dry exhaust
gas and air were measured using a combined paramagnetic/
infrared analyzer (NGA 2000, Rosemount, U.S.) via a MUX
multiplexer unit (B. Braun Biotech, Germany). Precultures
were carried out in unbaffled 500 mL conical flasks on 100 mL
of minimal medium as described above, adjusted to pH 6, and
7382

inoculated with 2 mL strain stocks. These were grown overnight in a rotary shaker, at 30 °C, 200 rpm, and then used to
inoculate the fermentor. Two growth conditions were investigated: chemostat and batch. The glucose-limited chemostat
culture was carried out at a dilution rate of 0.1 h-1. Sampling
took place after 6 residence times (60 h) of steady-state growth
with constant dissolved oxygen and off-gas readings, at a
biomass concentration of 3.7 gDW/L. For the batch culture, the
medium was supplemented before inoculation with a sterile
concentrated glucose solution, for an initial concentration of
30 g/L. Sampling took place in exponential glucose-consumption phase, 11 h after inoculation, at a biomass concentration
of 3.2 gDW/L. Biomass dry weight concentration was determined gravimetrically on membrane disk filters (PES, 0.45 µm,
Pall, U.S.) dried for 48 h at 70 °C. Preweighed filters were
loaded with 5-10 g of broth and washed with 3 volumes of
demineralized water.
Samples for Intracellular Metabolites. For an overview of
the experimental design, see Figure 1. Samples were taken using
a custom-made low dead-volume rapid sampling setup,23 and
leakage-free quenching was performed according to Canelas et
al.1 Briefly, 1.2 g (±0.06) of broth was withdrawn (<1 s) into 5 mL
of pure methanol at -40 °C, the mixture was quickly vortexed
(≈1 s) and placed back in the cryostat (-40 °C) (Lauda,
Germany). Extracellular medium was separated by centrifugation
(5000g, 5 min, -20 °C, rotor precooled to -40 °C). No additional
washing step was performed. After decanting, 200 µL of U-13Clabeled cell extract was added to half of the samples as internal
standard (IS).8,30 Each of the 5 different extractions was performed in quadruplicate: two samples with 13C-labeled IS (named
AQ: after quenching) and two samples without (BA, see below)
(Figure 1).
Metabolite Extraction Methods. The procedures for each
extraction method were adapted, in some cases with minor
simplifications, from the most relevant literature sources. For HW,
BE, CM, and FTM, these were the protocols most commonly used
for S. cerevisiae. In the case of AANM, for which there is yet no
source in the literature referring to its application to yeast cells,
we employed the protocol that gave optimal results in E. coli. The
details of each procedure are described individually below.
Hot Water (HW) Extraction. This procedure was adapted
from refs 4 and 31-34. Tubes containing 2 mL of demineralized
water were preheated in a water bath at 95-100 °C for 6 min.
Then, each sample was taken from the cryostat; the hot water
was quickly poured over the cell pellet; the mixture was immediately vortexed, and the sample was placed in the water bath.
After 15 min, each tube was placed on ice, and the extracts were
stored at -80 °C until further use.
Boiling Ethanol (BE) Extraction. This procedure was
adapted from refs 7, 23, 31, and 35. Tubes containing 5 mL of
75% ethanol were preheated in a water bath at 95 °C for 5 min.
Then, each sample was taken from the cryostat; the boiling ethanol
was quickly poured over the cell pellet; the mixture was immediately vortexed, and the sample was placed in the water bath.
After 3 min, each tube was transferred back to the cryostat (-40
°C), and the extracts were stored at -80 °C until further use.
Chloroform-Methanol (CM) Extraction. This procedure
was adapted from refs 6, 24, 36, and 37. Throughout the procedure,

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the experimental design.

the temperature of samples and solutions was maintained as close
as possible to -40 °C. Each sample was resuspended in 2.5 mL
of precooled 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol, after which 2.5 mL of
precooled chloroform was added. All samples were then vigorously
shaken for 45 min with an orbital shaker, using a custom-made
tube adaptor, inside a -40 °C freezer (temperature never above
-32 °C). The samples were then centrifuged (5000g, 5 min, -20
°C, rotor precooled to -40 °C); the upper water/methanol phases
were collected separately, and the lower layers were reextracted
with 2.5 mL precooled 50% (v/v) methanol by vortexing for 30 s.
After centrifugation, the upper phases were pooled with the first
extracts, and the combined extracts were stored at -80 °C until
further use.
Freezing-Thawing in Methanol (FTM) Extraction. This
procedure was adapted from refs 18, 24, and 38. Each sample was
resuspended in 2.5 mL of 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol precooled
to -40 °C; then, the resulting solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen
for 3-5 min and thawed on ice for 3-5 min. After three
freeze-thaw cycles, the samples were centrifuged (5000g, 5 min,
-20 °C); the supernatants were collected separately, and the
pellets were reextracted with 2.5 mL precooled 50% (v/v) methanol
by vortexing for 30 s. After centrifugation, the supernatants were
pooled with the first extracts, and the combined extracts were
stored at -80 °C until further use.
Acidic Acetonitrile-Methanol (AANM) Extraction. This
procedure was adapted from ref 19. Each sample was resuspended
in 1 mL of precooled (-20 °C) acidic acetonitrile/methanol/water
(40:40:20 v/v, containing 0.1 M formic acid) solution and placed
in a cryostat at -20 °C for 15 min. The samples were then
centrifuged (5000g, 5 min, 4 °C); the supernatants were collected
separately, and the pellets were reextracted twice with 200 µL of
ice-cold AANM solution, each time by vortexing for 20 s. Finally,
the pooled extracts (1.4 mL) were neutralized with 100 µL of 1.4
M NH4OH and stored at -80 °C until further use.
Sample Concentration and Conditioning. After thawing, BE,
CM, and FTM extracts were evaporated under vacuum (120 min,
30 °C, <10 mbar) using a RapidVac (Labconco, U.S.). Dried
residues of samples with 13C-labeled IS (AQ) and without (BA)

were resuspended in 600 µL or 400 µL of Milli-Q water,
respectively. All samples, including the HW and AANM
extracts, were then centrifuged (15 000g, 5 min, 4 °C) to remove
cell debris. The supernantants were transferred to filter caps
(Ultrafree, PVDF, 0.22 µm, Millipore) and centrifuged again,
and the filtrates were collected and stored at -80 °C. Finally,
to simulate the effect of typical waiting times during an analysis
run, all samples were thawed and left to stand in the refrigerator
(4-5 °C) for 8-9 h. At the end of this period, 200 µL of 13Clabeled IS was added to the half of the samples which had not
received it yet (named BA: before analysis), and all samples
were placed back at -80 °C until analysis.
Metabolite Analysis. The concentrations of glucose-6phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), glucose-1-phosphate
(G1P), mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
(FBP), trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), 6-phospho-gluconate (6PG),
3-phosphoglycerate + 2-phosphoglycerate (3PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), citrate + isocitrate
(Citrate), oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, sedoheptulose7-phosphate (S7P), and UDP-glucose were determined by anionexchange LC-MS/MS.39 The concentrations of AMP, ADP, ATP,
UMP, UDP, UTP, GDP, and CDP were determined by ion-pair
reverse-phase LC-MS/MS.40
The concentrations of 19 amino acids were determined by GC/
MS using the EZ:Faast Free Amino Acid Kit (Phenomenex, U.S.).
Extraction and derivatization of the amino acids were carried out
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, after a
solid-phase extraction (SPE) step, the amino acids are simultaneously derivatized in an aqueous medium on the amino- and
carboxyl group with n-propyl chloroformate in the presence of
n-propanol and 3-picoline, resulting in n-propoxycarbonyl npropylesters. Owing to the SPE step and the high specificity of
the derivatization reagent propyl chloroformate, sample matrix
effects such as high salt and buffer concentrations are limited and
other components as sugars and organic acids do not interfere
with the measurement. The derivatized extracts were analyzed
with a Trace GC Ultra equipped with a programmed temperature
vaporizer (PTV) injector and autosampler AI 3000 which was

directly coupled to a Trace DSQ single quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electron ionization source (Thermo Finnigan,
U.S.). One microliter of derivatized sample was injected on a ZBAAA column (medium polarity fused silica capillary column 10 m
× 0.25 mm ID with a film thickness of 0.25 µm). The PTV injector,
equipped with a glass liner with, carbofrit, was set in PTV-splitless
mode with an initial temperature of 45 °C and a splitless time of
1 min. The temperature of the PTV was raised at 14.5 °C/s to
280 °C, held for 5 min, and subsequently raised at 14.5 °C/s to
300 °C. The GC temperature was initially set at 45 °C and then
raised at 30 °C/min to 320 °C and held for 1 min. Helium was
used as carrier gas with a gas flow of 1.5 mL/min. The transfer
line to the MS was set to 250 °C and the ion source to 240 °C.
The electron ionization was operated with 70 eV. For quantitative
measurements, the MS was used in selected ion monitoring (SIM)
mode.
All analyses were performed in duplicate. U-13C-labeled cell
extract was added as internal standard to both samples and
calibration standards for IDMS-based quantification.8,30
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Whether for Quantitative or for Qualitative Purposes, the
Choice of Extraction Method can Affect the Results. An
objective evaluation of intracellular metabolite extraction methods
must be based primarily on the fulfillment of three essential
criteria: completeness of extraction, prevention of interconversion
(e.g., due to enzymatic activity), and absence of extensive
degradation (e.g., chemical, thermal). Here, we have evaluated
these criteria using a strictly quantitative approach, that is, based
7384

Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 81, No. 17, September 1, 2009

on the absolute determination of metabolite levels in cell extracts
obtained using different extraction techniques.
In these experiments, we have employed a novel approach for
determination of metabolite recoveries, based on the addition of
13
C-labeled IS at the beginning and end of the sample treatment
(see Figure 1). For samples named AQ, 13C-labeled IS was added
right after quenching (as is standard procedure), while for
samples named BA, it was added just before analysis. Thus, in
BA samples, the 13C-labeled IS will only correct for analytical
artifacts (e.g., sample matrix effects), while in AQ samples, it
will also compensate for losses during sample treatment (e.g.,
volume losses, partial degradation). Levels in AQ samples
provide a measure of the ability of each extraction method to
release metabolites from the cells, independent of their stability
during treatment, that is, its efficacy. By comparing levels in
BA and AQ samples, we can determine the change in
concentration of each metabolite over the entire sample
treatment, that is, its recovery.
In this respect, note that we are determining an overall process
recovery, including extraction, concentration, and a conditioning
period at 4-5 °C which was meant to simulate the effect of the
time samples spend waiting for analysis (see Figure 1). The reason
for doing so is that the extraction method applied determines the
extent of changes in metabolites not only during the extraction
itself but also potentially further down the sample treatment until
the actual point when the sample is injected in the LC or GC (for
example, if enzymatic activity is not fully inactivated). By determining overall process recoveries, all such changes are taken into
account.

In Figure 2, we present the measured metabolite levels in
samples extracted with each of the 5 methods tested, under the
two growth conditions investigated (chemostat and batch), for a
set of 9 representative metabolites (of the 44 analyzed) chosen to
cover a wide range of molecular weight (from <100 to >500 Da),
abundance (from <1 to >100 µmol/gDW), functional class (amino
acids, organic acids, phosphorylated intermediates, nucleotides)
and analytical method used (3 each). From these data, it is
clear that different extraction techniques can indeed result in
substantial differences in the measured metabolite levels.
Overall, the CM, BE, and HW methods seem to yield comparable metabolite levels, while AANM stands out with somewhat
lower levels for the phosphorylated compounds, and FTM can
result in both higher and lower levels, depending on the
metabolite and growth condition. Furthermore, even for experiments where the absolute metabolite levels are not required
but only a qualitative impression of their changes, the choice
of extraction method can still drastically influence the results.
This can be seen for Leu, 3PG, G6P, and the nucleotides in
Figure 2, for which even the direction of change observed
between growth conditions (glucose excess vs glucose limitation)
depends on the extraction technique used.
Comparison of Extraction Efficacy. As a measure of a
method’s ability to release metabolites from the cells, we have
defined extraction efficacy, versus the maximum among the five
techniques, for metabolite x under extraction method i, as

efficacy(vs max)x, i )

[x]iAQ
max[x]AQ

(1)

However, it became clear that in certain situations an extraction
method might yield higher metabolite concentrations than the
others; if, for example, remaining substrate is converted to
intermediates or macromolecules are broken down, in which case,
the efficacy of all other methods would appear, by comparison,
misleadingly low. If so, an alternative measure would be to
calculate an efficacy versus the median, rather than the maximum,
which we defined as

efficacy(vs median)x, i )

[x]iAQ
median[x]AQ

(2)

Note that these efficacy factors are comparative measures of
effectiveness, so the results do depend on the set of techniques
investigated. However, by comparing a sufficiently varied set of
methods, based on different extraction principles and separately
optimized for optimal release of metabolites, it seems safe to
assume that at least one of them, if not more, will completely
release any given metabolite. In this case, efficacies may be treated
as near-absolute measures.
The extraction efficacies of all 44 metabolites analyzed, for both
experiments, are plotted, for each extraction method, in Figure
3. The efficacy profiles for HW, BE, and CM are all very similar,
with efficacies near 1 for most of the metabolites. The profile for
AANM is similar to the former for a wide range of metabolites
but shows a clear discrimination of the larger, more polar
metabolites (e.g., di- and triphosphate compounds), for which
efficacies drop significantly. Finally, the profile for FTM is the

order of increasing molecular weight, for each of the extraction
methods, under both growth conditions (see Results and Discussion
for definitions of efficacy vs max and efficacy vs median). Data are

most scattered, with efficacies below 1 for a large number of
metabolites, as well as exceptionally high efficacies for a small
subset of compounds in the batch experiment. A clear bias is also
observed, as with AANM, toward lower extractability of the larger,
more polar compounds.
The uniformity of the results with HW, BE, and CM strongly
indicates that these three methods achieve near-complete extraction of all metabolites analyzed. The only remarkable exceptions
are six metabolites (PEP, 3PG, G6P, F6P, G1P, and M6P) which
were found at much higher levels in FTM extracts in the batch
experiment. Strikingly, the very same metabolites are found at
comparatively lower levels in the chemostat experiment. FurtherAnalytical Chemistry, Vol. 81, No. 17, September 1, 2009

7385

more, in both growth conditions, the FTM method achieved
overall poor efficacies, so it seems implausible that the difference
lies in metabolite extractability. Rather, the fact that all six
metabolites are fast-turnover glycolytic intermediates and their
levels are comparatively higher in the condition of glucose-excess,
but not glucose-limitation, points at the possibility of metabolite
formation from the substrate (the 13C-labeled IS would not
correct for that). Furthermore, the metabolites involved imply
that at least the whole glycolysis is active. This hypothesis is
strengthened by the evidence of more widespread enzyme
activity in FTM extracts provided by the recoveries, which we
shall discuss below.
Among the similarity between the results of HW, BE, and CM,
a few differences stand out upon closer inspection. The profiles
for BE and CM are particularly close, while HW yielded somewhat
higher levels of certain metabolites, especially Leu, Met, GDP,
succinate, Phe, and Ile (>2 standard deviations), followed by Trp,
fumarate, ADP, Ser, and Tyr (>1 standard deviation). In principle,
higher efficacies mean that HW has a better ability to extract these
metabolites. However, it is unclear why a few amino acids and
organic acids, but not others, should be better released by HW
than, say, BE. The occurrence of several amino acids among the
largest differences suggested an alternative possibility: that the
higher levels could originate from decomposition of macromolecules such as proteins. If protein hydrolysis occurred, the largest
relative contribution would be for those amino acids which are
most abundant in whole-protein compared to their free pool. If
we calculate, for each amino acid, the quotient between its
percentage in protein41 and its percentage in the free pool, the
highest are for Leu (31), Phe (22), Met (16), and Ile (13), followed
by Gly, Trp, Tyr, and Pro (5-10). The striking correspondence
with the amino acids which are higher in HW samples strongly
indicates that partial protein hydrolysis could indeed be the source.
Protein is a major component of biomass (≈0.4 g/gDW). We
estimate that the hydrolysis of as little as 0.2% of the cell protein
would be sufficient to explain the measured differences in free
pools. This also complicates experimental verification of amino
acid release from purified protein, as it is possible that only a
small number of labile proteins are degraded. It is conceivable
that the other metabolites elevated in HW extracts also
originate from macromolecular degradation, although the exact
biomass components that would generate succinate, fumarate,
GDP, and ADP upon thermal hydrolysis remain to be elucidated.
Comparison of Metabolite Recoveries. As a measure of the
stability of each metabolite throughout sample treatment with each
extraction technique, we have defined the overall process recovery
for metabolite x under extraction method i as

recoveryx, i )

[x]iBA
[x]iAQ

(3)

Since we are determining an overall process recovery, nonspecific
losses are to be expected simply by volume loss during centrifugation, filtration, etc. In our samples, estimated losses of 30-60 µL
would represent 5-10% (recoveries 90-95%). Thus, even allowing
for measurement error, losses of more than 15-20% indicate
metabolite degradation, especially if they are metabolite specific.
Conversely, mixed recoveries above as well as below 100% would

mean that metabolite conversion, either enzymatic or chemical,
is taking place during the sample treatment. Metabolite conversion
will distort the metabolic “snapshot” that each sample represents.
An extraction technique which does not effectively prevent it (e.g.,
by inactivating enzymatic activity) cannot be considered suitable
for metabolomics research.
The overall process recoveries of all analyzed metabolites, for
both experiments, are plotted, per extraction method, in Figure
4. The recovery profiles for HW, BE, and CM are quite comparable, with recoveries near 1 across all metabolites. The profile
for BE is noticeably the “flattest”, indicating the near absence of
metabolite-specific losses and excellent reproducibility. With CM
and HW only a few metabolite-specific effects were observed: in

the case of CM, the recovery was low for Asn (0.38, batch) and
Orn (0.71-0.74), while in the case of HW, it was low for Leu (0.61,
batch) and Met (0.54, chemostat).
Extraction with AANM led to much more pronounced losses.
While the recoveries for smaller, less polar compounds were very
reproducible and near 1, a few mid-MW metabolites had low
recoveries: Orn (0.48-0.52), Lys (0.63-0.68), His (0.54-0.59),
PEP (0.35-0.38), and 3PG (0.39-0.49). For the larger phosphorylated intermediates, the recoveries were systematically below
60% and some nucleotides (e.g., GDP, CDP, UTP, ADP, UDP)
must have been so affected that they could not be detected in
some of the samples. What these metabolites have in common is
that they correspond exactly to the positively charged side chaincontaining amino acids (the remaining, Arg, was not analyzed)
and the phosphorylated compounds. Why they are lost, however,
is unclear. Exposure to low pH is not very long (45-60 min total)
and is at low temperatures. Besides, both compound classes are
thought to be reasonably stable under acidic conditions. The
AANM and ammonia solutions were titrated against each other
before use (as a check), so prolonged exposure to low pH due to
inadequate neutralization can be excluded. An alternative explanation could be that the most polar, charged metabolites are not
entirely soluble in the cold solvent-rich mixture and, if partially
precipitated (e.g., with cell debris, trace elements), would be lost
during centrifugation and filtration.
The profile of recoveries for FTM extraction clearly shows that
metabolite stability is most problematic with this method. Not only
are there several observations of very low recoveries but also there
is a large number of recoveries above 100%. This confirms the
suspicions, discussed above, of remaining enzymatic activity
during the procedure. In addition, rather than being reproducibly
high or low in both experiments, for many metabolites, the
recovery depended on the origin of the samples. For example,
Asn, Orn, Lys, PEP, 3PG, 6PG, S7P, T6P, and UDP-glucose had
low recoveries in samples from the batch experiment but not from
the chemostat, while Gly, Ser, Leu, Met, and UMP had recoveries
above 100% in samples from the chemostat but not from the Batch.
Furthermore, for a series of fast-turnover metabolites: G3P, G6P,
F6P, G1P, M6P, AMP, CDP, UDP, ADP, GDP, UTP, and ATP,
recoveries were above 100% in chemostat samples and well below
100% in Batch samples. Consider for instance the hexosephosphates: in the batch their levels in AQ samples were far
higher than with the other extraction methods, which we have
attributed to assimilation of glucose (see above). However, in BA
samples, their levels had decreased again, indicating conversion
of the elevated pools into other intermediates later on in the
sample treatment. This would have been partly compensated by
the 13C-labeled IS in the AQ samples, giving the very low
recoveries but not in BA samples. Conversely, in the chemostat,
the hexose-phosphate levels in AQ samples were comparatively
low, indicating poor extractability, but in BA samples, the levels
were higher, again indicating interconversion between metabolite pools after extraction. This could, in principle, occur at any
stage after extraction, implying that enzymes were extracted
from the cells but not actually inactivated. Additionally, it cannot
be ruled out that conversion occurs also during extraction,
since the samples spend several minutes thawing at 0 °C, and
methanol and low temperatures do not prevent enzymatic

activity but merely slow it down.21,22 While the latter could
perhaps be prevented by thawing instead at -40 °C, the former
cannot. Note that the use of 13C-labeled IS is not meant to deal
quantitatively with metabolite conversion (that would require
the substrate/product ratios in the IS to be exactly the same
as in the sample) but rather with degradation and analytical
artifacts (e.g., matrix effects). In conclusion, the changes
observed in glycolytic intermediates are consistent with the
presence of enzymatic activity, and the extent of other metabolites exhibiting condition-dependency effects suggests this
activity is widespread. Since inactivation of enzymatic activity
is an essential requirement of an extraction method, these
results mean that FTM cannot be considered a suitable
technique for metabolomics research, at least in S. cerevisiae.
Finally, we would like to draw attention to the advantages of
the approach used here for the determination of recoveries in
comparison to the “traditional” approaches of spiking and standard
additions. In principle, these involve additions (at one or multiple
concentrations) of each metabolite to different samples. Furthermore, if the influence of sample treatment and analysis are to be
distinguished, separate additions must be performed at different
stages. Doing this separately for every metabolite requires so
many samples that in practice mixes of metabolites are used
instead. Not only does the addition of multiple metabolites make
interconversion difficult to notice but also the concentrations
added are sometimes so high that they may no longer reflect what
takes place in a real sample. This implies that the outcomes are
dependent on the actual mix of metabolites chosen and concentrations applied. These limitations are circumvented by the 13Clabeled IS approach designed here. Since the added (labeled)
metabolites do not interfere with the (unlabeled) metabolites
already present, recoveries reflect changes as they actually
occur in physiological samples. Since the IS mix is a cell extract
itself, thus containing all metabolites, distinguishing metabolome-wide losses over the entire sample processing can be
achieved with a modest experimental workload. Furthermore,
if the recoveries at individual stages of sample treatment need
to be distinguished, it is possible to extend the approach by
applying the 13C-labeled IS to additional replicate samples
before and after each processing step. Although that will
multiply the experimental effort several-fold, it should allow
losses to be tracked down to specific operations.
Our Verdict: Best Performance with BE and CM. From
the quantitative data presented above, the five extraction methods
investigated can be objectively evaluated in terms of completeness
of extraction, prevention of metabolite conversion, and metabolite
stability. We conclude that the best extraction performance is
obtained with the BE and CM methods. Both techniques achieved
quantitative extraction of all metabolites analyzed with near-100%
recoveries and good reproducibility. In the investigation of
biological phenomena (RSD > 15%), the metabolite profiles
obtained with these two methods should be nearly indistinguishable, which is quite remarkable considering they are based on
rather different extraction principles. The data from CM and BE
samples have been combined, and the resulting intracellular
metabolite levels for the two growth conditions investigated are
presented in Table 2.

Data are averages and standard deviations of four samples, two
extracted with BE and two with CM, each analyzed twice.

Extraction with HW gave results very similar to BE and CM
for most metabolites but raised some concerns regarding possible
hydrolysis of macromolecules, which is undesirable. Although an
incubation of 15 min is until now standard for extraction of yeast
cells, it seems very likely that a shorter extraction time would
lead to a performance comparable to that of BE. Extraction with
AANM gave poor results, with limited efficacy and low recoveries
for specific types of metabolites. Nevertheless, if the reason behind
the problems encountered with the more polar, charged metabolites is found and solved, it could eventually provide a viable

alternative to CM. Finally, according to our results, FTM cannot
effectively prevent metabolite conversion throughout the samples
treatment, most likely by failing to inactivate enzymatic activity,
and thus, cannot be considered an adequate extraction method.
Considering the inconsistency in the literature concerning
the evaluation of extraction methods illustrated in Table 1, it
is not surprising that our conclusions are partly in agreement
with some previous works and in disagreement with others.
In the interest of clarifying possible causes for the differences
in outcome, it is worth comparing our conclusions with those
of previous studies. At first sight, our most striking conclusion
would appear to be that FTM is not adequate as an extraction
method, since much of the recent literature, including some
of the most influential papers on this topic, consider it the best
technique.18,24,42-44 However, three of these studies, including
the original proponents of the method, did not determine
metabolite recoveries,18,42,44 thereby leaving two of the essential
requirements untested. In the study by Villas-Boas et al.,
metabolite recoveries were determined for 27 metabolites (14
of which also measured here) in extracts spiked with a mix of
the same compounds.24 Recoveries differed substantially between extraction methods and were generally quite low,
including for BE and CM extractions. Some metabolites, such
as sugar phosphates, were not recovered acceptably (>30%) with
any of the procedures, for which no explanation could be found.
CM and FTM had, overall, the least unsatisfactory recoveries
so the authors concluded FTM was the best choice, based on
higher extraction efficacy (judged from the number of GC peaks
detected) and lower solvent toxicity. A more recent study
actually found evidence of conversion of ATP to ADP and AMP
in ATP-spiked FTM extracts.43 Despite this, the authors
concluded that presence of enzyme activity was only a minor
drawback of the method and, based on experimental simplicity
and metabolite yields comparable to BE and PCA (in L.
plantarum, for 3 metabolites), selected it as their preferred
extraction method. From these considerations, we conclude
that, in the evaluation of the FTM method, the main sources
of discrepancy between this work and the literature lie in the
definition of evaluation criteria and the type of data used for
their verification.
Our results also differ from the literature regarding the
evaluation of the AANM extraction. The proponents of the
method compared it to FTM and CM (and a few other
variations) for the extraction of metabolites from E. coli.19
Contrary to our results, they found that CM gave lower
metabolite levels than AANM or FTM. However, the authors
had adapted the procedure for CM extraction6 by applying no
mixing of the two-phase system. Interestingly, another study
also in E. coli where only short periods of mixing (3 × 30 s)
were applied for CM extraction also concluded it had limited
efficacy.18 Insufficient interfacial stress could well explain why
CM failed to perform better than FTM and AANM, although it
does not explain why it performed worse. This discrepancy may
well be related to organism-specific differences. In the comparison between FTM and AANM, the authors preferred AANM
because they found less metabolite conversion (attributed to
chemical degradation) in nucleotide-spiked samples than with
the FTM method. This is partially in agreement with our

findings, since presence of enzymatic activity in FTM extracts
(see above) would explain the conversions between metabolites
which they observed. Finally, the authors also concluded that
AANM gave the best performance for the extraction of
nucleotides, which is opposite to our findings. If our hypothesis
of metabolite precipitation were true, it is unclear why the E.
coli samples would be less affected. On the other hand, it also
cannot be excluded that losses were also taking place in their
study since metabolite recoveries were not determined.
To our knowledge, BE, CM, and HW extractions had not been
compared together before, although several works compared at
least two of them. Among those studies, half concluded they gave
similar results,31,42,45,46 while the other half found significant
differences.18,24,43,47 As discussed above, in some instances, the
poor performance found with CM might be related to insufficient
mixing of the two-phase system.18,43 Villas-Boas et al.,24 also using
S. cerevisiae, found particularly poor recoveries with BE extraction
for several metabolites, among them hexose-phosphates (100%
loss), Lys, Phe, Trp, citrate, and oxoglutarate, which were
completely stable in our experiments. The cause of this discrepancy is unknown. However, it should be noted that their finding
of 0% recovery for hexose-phosphates is not in agreement with
the fact that these metabolites can be routinely assayed in BE
extracts at several laboratories.48-52 In the study of Hiller et al.,47
HW extraction was considered superior to BE in terms of
reproducibility and linearity of standard additions (from which
detection limits were determined). These aspects cannot be easily
compared between studies since reproducibility can be affected
by so many different factors. In our study, the reproducibility with
HW and BE was comparable. In fact, the average RSD between
metabolite levels (n ) 88) in duplicate biological samples was
below 5% with BE, HW, or CM.
Finally, let us consider how our findings relate with the idea
that comprehensive coverage of the metabolome can only be
achieved using a combination of parallel extraction methods.
This notion can be traced back to the works of Maharjan and
Ferenci and Villas-Boas et al.18,24 Having observed a large
disparity in results with different extraction methods and in
the absence of one method that was better for all metabolites,
Maharjan and Ferenci concluded it was unlikely that a single
extraction method could cover all metabolites, given their
variety in chemical and physical properties. Their conclusion
was based on relative measurements of 13 metabolites, most
with poor reproducibility, and no data on metabolite recoveries.
This frame of mind may have led Villas-Boas et al. to express
their results in terms of metabolite classes rather than
individual compounds. Having observed a large disparity in the
recoveries of 27 metabolites, they concluded that every method
discriminated particular metabolite classes and concluded that
developing a method that could extract the large variety of
compounds in the cell was an impossible task. Since then, these
notions have been supported by at least two reviews on the
topic (one of which was by our group)53,54 and by some of the
most recent literature.42 An additional contributing factor may
have been the inconsistency between published method comparisons, illustrated in Table 1. However, the results we have
presented here are not consistent with that view. Admittedly,

we have analyzed only a subset of the metabolome, from which
is it dangerous to extrapolate. It cannot be excluded that
extraction performances differ significantly for functional
classes not analyzed here, such as lipids, sugars, CoA derivatives, etc. Nevertheless, the fact that all metabolites analyzed
could be extracted with high efficacies and near-100% recoveries
by at least two very different extraction techniques deserves
being considered before assuming that metabolome-wide
extraction is an impossible feat, in yeast as well as other
microorganisms.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
For accurate determination of intracellular metabolite levels
in S. cerevisiae, samples should be extracted using boiling
ethanol or chloroform-methanol. Both methods gave high
efficacies and excellent recoveries for the whole range of
metabolites analyzed here. Hot water also performs generally
well but raises the risk of overestimating some metabolite pools,
presumably due to macromolecule hydrolysis, although this
can probably be minimized with a shorter incubation time. The
performance of acidic acetonitrile-methanol is inferior, for
reasons not yet elucidated. Freezing-thawing in methanol is
inadequate as an extraction method, as it does not ensure
inactivation of enzymatic activity.
Some aspects of metabolite extraction are species dependent,
so the performance of the different techniques available should
be adequately validated with each microorganism. Furthermore,
extraction performance may, in some cases, depend on the history
of the sample, so method comparisons can benefit if investigations
are performed under more than one growth condition (e.g.,
chemostat and batch).
The approach outlined here, of applying 13C-labeled internal
standards at different stages of the sample treatment process,
is particularly useful for the determination of metabolite
recoveries.
The choice of methods for the earliest steps in sample
treatment can affect the outcome of a metabolomics-based experiment to the extent that even the direction of changes in metabolite
levels may be distorted. Insufficient validation of the experimental
procedures used, thus, compromises the results of subsequent
research and conclusions derived thereof.
