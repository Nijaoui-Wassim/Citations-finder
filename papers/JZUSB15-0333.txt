Abstract:
This study proposed a quenching protocol for metabolite analysis of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus. Microbial cells were quenched with 60% methanol/water, 80% methanol/glycerol, or 80% methanol/water.
The effect of the quenching process was assessed by the optical density (OD)-based method, flow cytometry, and gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least
squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were employed for metabolite identification. The results indicated that
quenching with 80% methanol/water solution led to less damage to the L. bulgaricus cells, characterized by the lower
relative fraction of prodium iodide (PI)-labeled cells and the higher OD recovery ratio. Through GC-MS analysis, higher
levels of intracellular metabolites (including focal glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and AMP) and a lower leakage
rate were detected in the sample quenched with 80% methanol/water compared with the others. In conclusion, we
suggested a higher concentration of cold methanol quenching for L. bulgaricus metabolomics due to its decreasing
metabolite leakage.

1 Introduction
Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is an
important lactobacillus commonly used for fermented
milk products (Garbayo et al., 2004; Schiraldi et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2009). The metabolic capacities of L.
bulgaricus were responsible for the development of
milk acidification and formations of texture and
aroma (Russell and Diez-Gonzalez, 1998; Siegumfeldt et al., 2000). However, a traditional biochemistry method was difficult to effectively identify and

quantify the intracellular metabolites of the bacteria
(Nielsen, 1997; Schaefer et al., 1999; Lange et al.,
2001). Recently, rapidly growing reports demonstrated that microbial metabolomics could provide
more data and describe higher complex metabolite
profiles (Oldiges et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2008; Tang et
al., 2009). Typical detection methods in metabolome
analysis include gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography (LC)-MS,
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR),
which offer higher sensitivity and the ability to detect
a larger number of low-molecular weight metabolites
(van Dam et al., 2002; Coulier et al., 2006; Koek et
al., 2006). Accordingly, further studies on metabolomics could contribute to a better understanding on
the necessary role of L. bulgaricus in fermentation.
L. bulgaricus metabolomics requires efficient
and reliable quenching and extracting methods. Cold

methanol-water quenching was considered as a general procedure to rapidly inactivate bacteria metabolism, which has been widely applied to Escherichia
coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeast (Castrillo et al.,
2003; Jana et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2010). The effect
of methanol quenching on the leakage of intracellular
metabolites has been widely studied. Wittmann et al.
(2004) showed that a lower concentration of methanol
quenching significantly reduced the leakage of metabolites in Corynebacterium glutamicum. However,
Canelas et al. (2008) proposed that the intracellular
components of Saccharomyces cerevisiae could be
effectively protected by quenching in 80% methanol.
Link et al. (2008) observed that methanol-glycerol
quenching fluid showed lower leakage compared to
methanol-water quenching fluid. In addition, many
studies focused on the effect of quenching on the cell
membrane integrity. Schädel et al. (2011) used an optical density (OD)-based method and flow cytometry to
investigate the cell damage in E. coli during quenching.
However, few studies reported on the quenching method for lactobacillus metabolomics analysis.
This study aimed to examine different quenching
solutions for the investigation of the L. bulgaricus
metabolomics. The optimized quenching processing
for L. bulgaricus would be applicable for other
lactobacillus.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Bacterial strain and growth conditions
L. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 was obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. The bacteria
were cultivated in a 3.7-L laboratory fermenter
(Bio-Rad, Switzerland) at 37 °C, 200 r/min, and pH
6.2±0.2 until the cells reached the stationary phase.
The chemically defined medium was prepared in
accordance with Otto et al. (1983).
2.2 Quenching process
Three quenching fluids were prepared: 60%
methanol/water (Meth), 80% methanol/glycerol
(Meth/gly), and 80% Meth.
The bacteria cells of L. bulgaricus were collected by centrifugation at 7000g for 5 min at 4 °C.
Subsequently, re-suspended cells were washed twice
with 0.9% saline solution at 4 °C. The samples were

then quenched with 5 ml of three different methanol
liquids respectively, followed by being vortex-mixed
and centrifuged at 10 000g for 5 min at −20 °C.
The supernatants were removed quickly and
used as extracellular samples for analyzing the leakage of intracellular metabolites. Simultaneously, the
quenched bacteria cells were extracted by 2 ml boiling ethanol/water (3:1, v/v) solution (95 °C) according to Faijes et al. (2007). After that, the preparations
were centrifugated (10 000g, 5 min, −20 °C), and the
supernatant was frozen at −80 °C and used as an
intracellular sample for analyzing the metabolite levels in L. bulgaricus.
2.3 Cell leakage test
OD recovery ratio was used to quantify the whole
cell damage (Schädel et al., 2011), which was calculated as the OD value at 660 nm (OD660) of untreated
sample/OD660 of treated sample). Briefly, the OD660
values of untreated samples were first monitored using a
spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Germany).
Subsequently, the quenched cell pellets were
re-suspended in 4 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
which allowed for detecting the decrease of OD660 of
the cell suspensions.
Flow cytometry was used for quantitative analysis of single cell damage (Schädel et al., 2011). The
quenched cell suspensions, added with 10 μl/ml prodium iodide (PI) staining solution, were mixed gently
and incubated for 4 min in the dark. The PI fluorescence was detected (using the FL-2 or FL-3 channel)
by a flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, USA). The data
of unstained cells (intact cell membrane) and singlecolor positive cells (damaged cell membrane) were
obtained for quantifying the undamaged and damaged
cells.
2.4 Evaluation of quenching protocols by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
Metabolites extracted from the L. bulgaricus
were tested by GC-MS analysis. Firstly, 10 μl of
13
C6-leucine (20 μg/ml) was added into each of the
200 μl re-dissolved samples. Then, the solution was
mixed for 5 s and dried under nitrogen gas at 50 °C for
30 min. Subsequently, the sample was transferred to a
GC vial and 30 μl of 20 mg/ml methoxy amine pyridine hydrochloride was added, mixed for 30 s and
oxidated at 37 °C for 90 min. N,O-bis(trimethylsily)

Chen et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2014 15(4):333-342

trifluoractamide (BSTFA) of a volume of 30 μl containing 1% (v/v) trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was
added to each vial and the mixture was incubated for
30 min at 70 °C. Ultimately, a devitalized sample was
kept at room temperature for 30 min.
Agilent 7890A/5975C GC/MS, including an HP5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m×0.25 mm×
0.25 μm) was used for metabolite analysis. The injector temperature was set at 280 °C. The electronic
ignition (EI) ion source temperature was set at 230 °C.
Helium (99.999%) was used as a carrier gas at a flow
rate of 1.0 ml/min, and 1-μl sample was injected in a
spoutless mode. The column temperature was first
kept at 80 °C for 2 min, increased to 320 °C at a rate
of 10 °C/min and maintained for 6 min. The mass
spectrometer was operated in the scan mode at the
mass range of 50–550 m/z.
2.5 Statistical analysis
After GC-MS analysis, statistical preprocessing
was performed using XCMS software (https://
xcmsonline.scripps.edu/?) under an R platform and
later edited in Microsoft Excel 2010. Impurity peaks
produced from sample preparation and column
bleeding were wiped out, and all results containing
variables, peak-area, and observables are organized
into a 2D matrix. The preprocessed GC-MS data were
then imported into Simca-P software (Version 11.0)
and principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis
(OPLS-DA) were executed. PCA was used to differentiate the samples. OPLS-DA analysis was used to
filter the quadrature signal. The efficiencies of the
models were determined by values of R2 and Q2. In
addition, permutation tests were performed to test the
validity of the OPLS-DA models. Statistical significance was evaluated using the t-test and P<0.1 was
considered significant.

3 Results
3.1 Impact of quenching protocols on single cell
damage
The PI dye can bind to nucleic acids inside the
cells and then form a red fluorescent signal, which can
be detected by flow cytometry (Díaz et al., 2010).
Thus, the PI-staining method was applied to examine

335

the degree of damage to the cells after the aqueous
methanol quenching.
Because PI is a membrane impermeant dye, the
cell without treating and quenching had relatively
intact membranes and exhibited a 3% PI labeling
(Figs. 1 and 2). The variation of the composition of
methanol solutions changed the ratio of PI-labeled
cells. Compared with the 60% Meth quenching, the
80% Meth quenching caused less damage to the
L. bulgaricus cells. In addition, the 80% Meth/gly
effectively protected the cell membranes and reduced
the ratio of PI labeling to 6.6%, which was significantly less than that in the Meth quenching (P<0.05).
3.2 Impact of quenching protocols on whole cell
damage
We further analyzed the total cell rupture by
monitoring the reduction of OD660 in the quenching
samples (Fig. 3). It was found that the OD660 recovery
ratio of the cold 80% Meth/gly was higher than those
of other quenching methods, which indicated that
Meth/gly had a positive effect on preventing the L.
bulgaricus cell lyses.
The OD660 recovery ratio of 80% Meth quenching was higher than that of 60% Meth quenching
(P>0.05). The result also indicated that adoption of
80% Meth as a quenching fluid could decrease the
cell rupture.
3.3 Evaluation of intracellular metabolite profiles
of L. bulgaricus
The results of GC-MS showed that there was a
strong signal with good sensitivity and reproducibility
in the GC-MS total ion chromatograms (TICs) of all
samples. However, other peak areas of the 80%
Meth/gly chromatogram were covered due to a saturated peak glycerol present at 8.55 min of retention
time (Fig. 4b). It respectively found 807, 603, and 841
substances in the GC/MS TICs of 60% Meth, 80%
Meth/gly, and 80% Meth samples, including ATP and
its derivatives, amino acids, organic acids, sugars, and
fatty acids (Fig. 4).
The PCA score plot showed that the samples
prepared by different methanols were clearly separated, although 80% Meth/gly and 80% Meth were
grouped closely (Fig. 5a). Detailed insight into the
differences can be identified by examining the PCA
loading plot (Fig. 5b). The major compounds that

were palmitic acid and stearic acid. Moreover, focal
glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and AMP were
the metabolites which contributed to the separation

of the 80% Meth samples from others. It is suggested
that the 80% Meth quenching method was superior to
quenching with 60% Meth and 80% Meth/gly, because larger amounts of metabolites were detected.

in the form of p(1) and p(2)

3.4 Evaluation of extracellular metabolite profiles
of L. bulgaricus
Since L. bulgaricus cells were sensitive to methanol quenching procedures so as to lose their
intracellular metabolites, the concentrations of
extracellular (supernatant) metabolite were also
measured by GC-MS.
The PCA score plot in Fig. 5c showed that the
supernatant metabolites of 60% and 80% Meth
groups were clearly separated, which was in accordance with the high R2X value of 0.834 and Q2 value
of 0.56. It indicated that the prediction performance of
PCA models was good. A few kinds of metabolites

in the two quenched supernatants were significantly
different (Fig. 5d). Asparagine, serine, AMP, and
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) were presented in the
supernatant of the 60% Meth group. The metabolites
in the supernatant of the 80% Meth group were
mainly glutamic acid, valine, threonine, and aspartate.

quenching group (one orthogonal and two predictive
components, R2X=0.941, R2Y=1, Q2=0.999) and the
extracellular and intracellular metabolites of the 80%
Meth quenching group (R2X=0.901, R2Y=1, Q2=0.998)
indicated that the two models were reliable and
the metabolic samples had significant differences
(Figs. 6a and 6b). Furthermore, the OPLS-DA models
were validated with a permutation test (200 times).
The results of the tests further verified the performance of the model showing that Q2 was relatively
high than R2 (Figs. 6c and 6d).
The experimental results showed that 45 kinds of
metabolites had significant differences between supernatant and intracellular substances from the 60%
and 80% Meth quenching groups. Among them, 18
kinds of different metabolites were identified. According to the relative content of these metabolites,
we were able to calculate the effect of the 60% and
80% Meth quenching on the leakage rate of intracellular metabolites in L. bulgaricus. As shown in Fig. 7,
the leakage rates of cell metabolites affected by 80%
Meth quenching were less than those affected by 60%
Meth quenching. If 80% Meth was used for quenching, the leakage rates of the 14 kinds of metabolites
were lower than those using the 60% Meth, such as
alanine, glycine, and glutamine. However, the leakage
rates of four kinds of metabolites, including propanoic acid, ethylphoric acid, N-acetylmethionine, and
tetradecanoic acid, by 80% Meth quenching were
higher than those by the cold 60% Meth quenching.

4 Discussion
Bacterial cells are sensitive to quenching solutions, which results in damage to the cell wall and
membrane and the loss of intracellular metabolites
(Duetz and Witholt, 2004; Kumar et al., 2004).
Therefore, this study focused on comparing different
methanol solutions, including 60% Meth, 80%
Meth/gly, and 80% Meth, for proposing an appropriate quenching protocol for L. bulgaricus.
Firstly, we evaluated the effects of quenching
protocols on the membrane integrity and cell lysis by
flow cytometry using PI dye and OD recovery ratio. It
was found that increasing the methanol concentration
or using the glycerol as a buffer was very effective for
reducing cell membrane damage. Previous studies

confirmed that both methanol and glycerol were effective cryoprotectants for L. bulgaricus and had the
ability to enhance the cell viability against freezing
damage (Carvalho et al., 2004; Fonseca et al., 2006).
Especially, glycerol as a permeable compound could
protect freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria through inhibiting excess dehydration, reducing salt toxicity, and
preventing ice crystals formation (Huang et al., 2006).
Recently, isosmotic glycerol solution was widely
applied as a quenching agent to maintain osmotic
pressure for bacterial cells (Villas-Bôas and Bruheim,
2007). This work found that 80% Meth/gly quenching
could reduce the cell damage to L. bulgaricus. Hence,
it is suggested that L. bulgaricus cells quenched in the
presence of glycerol could effectively protect the
stability of cell membrane.
Subsequently, the extracellular and intracellular
metabolite profiles of L. bulgaricus affected by different quenching fluids were assessed based on
GC-MS and PCA analytical methods. On the one
hand, we found that it was difficult to remove the
glycerol from the supernatant of quenched samples,
which severely affected the results of the GC-MS
analysis. Therefore, the data for the extracellular
metabolite samples of 80% Meth/gly quenching were
discarded. On the other hand, the GC-MS analysis of
intracellular metabolite profiles revealed that 600–
800 metabolite compounds were detected, in which
196 kinds of compounds were identified and 113
kinds of metabolites were represented. The effect of
the methanol concentration on the levels of metabolite extracts was further evaluated. In accordance with
the findings of Canelas et al. (2008), we showed
consistently higher concentrations of intracellular
metabolites from the samples treated with 80% Meth
compared with 60% Meth. These results suggest that
the 80% Meth, acting as a protective agent, could
prevent the losses of metabolites from the cells.
Further, OPLS-DA was employed to investigate
the differences between extracellular and intracellular
metabolite profiles derived from different quenching
methods. The reliabilities of the OPLS-DA models
had been validated by permutation tests. The OPLSDA score plots showed a trend toward differentiating
between supernatant and intracellular samples
quenched with 60% or 80% Meth. In accordance with
the previous studies, cold methanol quenching led to
some metabolite losses from bacterial cells (Bolten

Chen et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2014 15(4):333-342

et al., 2007; Spura et al., 2009). In our study, the supernatant sample of 80% Meth treatment contained
lower concentrations of metabolites compared with
the remaining intracellular concentrations. Furthermore, the leakage rate of the sample prepared using
80% Meth was lower than that of the 60% Meth group,
suggesting that the 80% Meth quenching method is a
preferable method for the analysis of the intracellular
metabolites from L. bulgaricus.

5 Conclusions
In summary, quenching is a critical step in the
evaluation of L. bulgaricus metabolomics. Compared
to the general quenching in 60% cold methanol fluid,
it is proposed that a 80% cold methanol or 80% cold
methanol/glycerol solution was better for reducing
the extent of leakage and examining higher concentrations of intracellular metabolites. The application
of an optimized quenching process would contribute
to identifying the specific biomarkers and also help to
analyze the metabolic characteristics of L. bulgaricus.
