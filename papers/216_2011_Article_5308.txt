Abstract Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography
(HILIC) provides an alternative approach to effectively
separate small polar compounds on polar stationary phases.
The purpose of this work was to review the options for the
characterization of HILIC stationary phases and their
applications for separations of polar compounds in complex
matrices. The characteristics of the hydrophilic stationary
phase may affect and in some cases limit the choices of mobile
phase composition, ion strength or buffer pH value available,
since mechanisms other than hydrophilic partitioning could
potentially occur. Enhancing our understanding of retention
behavior in HILIC increases the scope of possible applications
of liquid chromatography. One interesting option may also be
to use HILIC in orthogonal and/or two-dimensional separations. Bioapplications of HILIC systems are also presented.

Introduction
A theoretical description of analyte retention in highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been the
subject of various publications. There are several ways to
model the separation mechanism: partition, adsorption, ion
exchange, and size exclusion. This mechanism is based on

specific and nonspecific interactions [1–4]. Nevertheless,
there is currently no detailed quantitative retention model
that would allow the chromatographic parameters for
individual analytes separated under given conditions to be
accurately predicted.
Normal or reversed-phase liquid chromatography can be
used for analysis. In normal phase liquid chromatography
(NP-LC), the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile
phase. The retention increases as the polarity of the mobile
phase decreases, and thus polar analytes are more strongly
retained than nonpolar ones. The opposite situation occurs in
reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) [5]. NP-LC
has been widely used to separate various compounds, from
nonpolar to highly polar compounds (note that chromatography was first introduced as a method used in separation
science). Although RP-LC systems were previously commonly
used by scientists, NP-LC methods are currently undergoing a
renaissance.
Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is
an alternative high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) mode for separating polar compounds. For historical
reasons, it has been reported that HILIC is a variant of normal
phase liquid chromatography, but the separation mechanism
used in HILIC is more complicated than that in NP-LC. While
the acronym HILIC was first suggested by Alpert in 1990 [6],
the number of publications on HILIC has increased
substantially since 2003 (Fig. 1), as outlined in the wellconstructed review by Hemström and Irgum [7].
Like NP-LC, HILIC employs traditional polar stationary
phases such as silica, amino or cyano [8–12], but the mobile
phase used is similar to those employed in the RP-LC mode
[7, 11, 12]. HILIC also allows the analysis of charged
substances, as in ion chromatography (IC). Figure 2 shows
how HILIC complements other areas of chromatography and
extends the range of separation options.

HILIC has many specific advantages over conventional
NP-LC and RP-LC. For example, it is suitable for analyzing
compounds in complex systems that always elute near the
void in reserved-phase chromatography. Polar samples always
show good solubility in the aqueous mobile phase used in
HILIC, which overcomes the drawbacks of the poor solubility
often encountered in NP-LC. Expensive ion pair reagents are
not required in HILIC, and it can be conveniently coupled to
mass spectrometry (MS), especially in the electrospray
ionization (ESI) mode. In contrast to RP-LC, gradient elution
HILIC begins with a low-polarity organic solvent and elutes
polar analytes by increasing the polar aqueous content [13]. A
desirable mobile phase would contain high organic content
for better sensitivity and also show good on-column retention
for polar ionic compounds. Hydrophilic interaction liquid
chromatography has established itself as the separation mode
of choice for uncharged highly hydrophilic and amphiphilic

compounds that are too polar to be well retained in RP-LC
but have insufficient charge to allow effective electrostatic
retention in ion-exchange chromatography. HILIC separation is currently attracting a lot of interest since it solves
many previously difficult separation problems, such as the
separation of small organic acids, basic drugs, and many other
neutral and charged substances. It has been successfully
applied to the analysis of carbohydrates [14, 15], peptides [8,
16, 17] and polar pharmaceuticals [11, 18], etc.
This paper covers fundamental developments in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography. The objective of the
present work is to review options for the characterization of
HILIC stationary phases and their applications to separations
of polar compounds in complex matrices. Gaining a thorough
understanding of retention behavior in HILIC enhances the
scope of applications of liquid chromatography. The separation mechanism can depend on many factors, such as the
physicochemical properties of the stationary phase and
hydroorganic mobile phase, and the structures of the samples
investigated. Precisely defining which mechanism prevails is
currently a difficult and complicated task. This phenomenon is
still waiting for theoretical elucidation.

Stationary phases for the HILIC mode

Fig. 2 HILIC combines the characteristics of the three major methods
in liquid chromatography

Any polar chromatographic surface can be used for HILIC
separations. Typical HILIC stationary phases consist of
classical bare silica or silica gels modified with many polar
functional groups. Polymer-based stationary phases can also
be used.
The first generation of HILIC mode separations started
in 1975. Linden et al. [19] separated carbohydrates by an

amino-silica phase, Bondapak (Waters, Milford, MA, USA)
in a mixture of acetonotrile and water (75:25 v/v). The next
generation of stationary phases for HILIC used DIOL- and
amide-silica. The DIOL-silica column has mainly been used
for the separation of proteins [20, 21]. According to Tosoh,
producer of TSKgel Amide-80, amide-silica columns have
been available since at least 1985. This particular phase is
described as consisting of nonionic carbamoyl groups that
are chemically bonded to the silica gel, but it is commonly
known as an amide-bonded silica. After Yoshida [22] applied
these phases to the separation of peptides, the amide-silica
phase soon found common usage in HILIC. Chemically
bonded stationary phases with specific structural properties
have been prepared by Buszewski et al. [23–25]. One of
them contains aminopropyl ligands bonded to silica (SG–
NH2); others are an alkylamide packing phase (SG-AP) and
a mixed phase (SG-MIX) containing different types of
ligands (–NH2, –CN, –Ph, –C8, –C18) bonded to the support.
Over the last 15 years, HILIC has progressed into second
and third generation implementations, most of which involve
mixed or multiple-interaction solid phases. Many column
vendors sell both traditional HILIC and its more sophisticated
relatives. Some novel separation materials for HILIC have
attracted increasing attention in recent years [7, 18, 26–31].
Hence, the structural variations of HILIC-type stationary
phases are wider than those found in reversed-phase systems.
HILIC phases can be grouped into neutral polar or ionic
surfaces. Table 1 shows the different structures of stationary
phases that are applicable to HILIC-mode separation. These
special separation materials for HILIC show good selectivity and reproducibility for the separation of polar compounds. Although the number of commercially available
columns designed especially for HILIC is growing, there is
still no versatile stationary phase like C18 in RP-LC.
However, different types of separation materials for HILIC
have different retention characteristics and separation
selectivities.
Unmodified bare silica gel has some advantages for
HILIC, in contrast to chemically bonded stationary phases.
Type A silica gels, prepared by precipitation from the
solutions of silicates, are acidic because they are polluted
with certain metals that activate surface silanol groups and
form complexes with some chelating solutes, causing
strong retention or asymmetric peaks. Type B silica gels
are formed by the aggregation of silica sols in air, contain
very low amounts of metals, and are more stable at
intermediate and higher pH values (up to at least pH 9)
than xerogel-type materials. They generally provide better
separations, especially for basic samples, because they are
highly purified, less acidic “sol-gel” spherical silica
particles [57]. At higher pH values, silanol groups are
ionized and cation exchange plays a important role in
retention, especially for positively charged basic com-

233

pounds. Suppressing silanol ionization through the addition
of TFA may promote the ion-pairing mechanism. Similar
effects have also been observed in HILIC on monolithic
silica gel columns, which offer higher permeability than the
particle-packed HILIC columns [58]. Silica gel type C with
a hydrosilated surface populated with nonpolar silicon
hydride Si–H groups instead of silanol groups may have
up to 95% of its original silanols removed, making it less
polar than silica gels with higher populations of silanol
groups [59]. It can be used to separate acids or bases in the
HILIC mode in buffered mobile phases containing more
than 50–70% organic solvent (acetonitrile).
DIOL, amino, amide and other bonded phases used in
HILIC are usually prepared by chemically modifying the
silica gel surface, like the C18 phases used for RP-LC [8, 60].
Chemically bonded DIOL phases demonstrate high polarity
and hydrogen bonding properties, and do not contain
ionizable groups other than unreacted residual silanols,
meaning that they are appropriate for the HILIC mode
[61]. Bonded amino-silica columns are relatively often used
in the HILIC mode. While basic analytes are in general
strongly retained on silica gel by hydrogen bonding and ionexchange interactions with silanol groups, acidic compounds
show increased affinities to amino-silica columns, which
can sometimes even lead to irreversible adsorption [8].
Chemically bonded phases with other functionalities, such as
polyethylene glycol or alkyls with embedded amide or
carbamate groups, are generally proposed for RP applications in water-rich mobile phases. On the other hand, when
the percentage of organic solvent is high, the retention of
many compounds increases with increasing concentration of
acetonitrile, showing typical NP behavior [6, 47, 62].
Cyclodextrin-silica stationary phases that possess several
linked glucopyranoside units and have chiral recognition
properties are useful for HILIC chiral separations [40].
Zwitterionic sulfoalkylbetaine stationary phases have also
been introduced for HILIC separations. The active layer, which
is grafted onto wide-pore silica gel or a polymer support,
contains both strongly acidic sulfonic acid groups and strongly
basic quaternary ammonium groups separated by a short
alkyl spacer. Ion-exchange interactions of the zwitterionic
stationary phase are assumed. The sulfoalkylbetaine bonded
phases strongly adsorb water by hydrogen bonding, and
the bulk layer of water, which forms part of the stationary
phase, then largely controls the retention mechanism.
Zwitterionic columns are commercially available under the
tradenames ZIC-HILIC (on a silica gel support) and ZICpHILIC (on a polymer support) [12].
The separation of neutral compounds on ion exchangers
under typical HILIC conditions has been known about for a
very long time. On both cation-exchange and anion-exchange
styrene-divinylbenzene resins, only the retentions of some
polar compounds (e.g., carbohydrates and related substances)

observed [62–64]. Due to the presence of ion-exchange

groups, a mixed-mode HILIC/ion-exchange mechanism controls the retention, which may cause specific selectivity
effects. The mixed anion-exchange/cation-exchange/HILIC

purification of compounds from natural products [18].

Mobile phase selection
A typical mobile phase for HILIC chromatography includes
water-miscible polar organic solvents such as acetonitrile
with a small amount of water [6]. However, any aprotic
solvent that is miscible with water (e.g., tetrahydrofuran,
THF, and/or dioxane) can be used. Alcohols can also be
adopted, although a higher concentration is needed to

achieve the same degree of retention of the analyte relative
to an aprotic solvent–water combination [7].
An eluotropic row is useful for selecting a suitable
organic modifier for the mobile phase. This lists solvents
according to increasing elution strength. Relative solvent
strengths in HILIC can be approximately summarized as
follows:
acetone < isopropanol  propanol < acetonitrile
< ethanol < dioxane < DMF  methanol < water
HILIC separations are performed either in isocratic mode
with a high percentage of organic solvent or with gradients

236

starting with a high percentage of organic solvent and
ending with a high proportion of aqueous solvent [6].
It is commonly believed that in HILIC, the mobile phase
forms a water-rich layer on the surface of the polar stationary
phase vs. the water-deficient mobile phase, creating a liquid/
liquid extraction system. The analyte is distributed between
these two layers [6, 33].

Mobile phase additives
Ionic additives, such as ammonium acetate and ammonium
formate, are typically used to control the mobile phase pH
and ion strength. In HILIC, they can also contribute to the
polarity of the analyte, resulting in differential changes in
retention. For ionizable analytes, such as aminoglycoside
antibiotics, the pH must be adjusted to ensure that the
analyte will be in a single ionic form. Increasing the buffer
concentration decreases the retention if ion exchange
controls the retention, while the opposite effect may occur,
affecting the solvation, in the absence of ion exchange
under HILIC conditions. If this is not done, an asymmetric
peak shape, chromatographic peak “tailing,” and/or poor
recovery from the stationary phase will be observed. No buffer
is needed to separate neutral polar analytes (e.g., carbohydrates). The use of other salts (such as 100–300 mM sodium
perchlorate) that are soluble in high organic solvent mixtures
(ca. 70% acetonitrile) can be used to increase the polarity of
the mobile phase in order to achieve elution. These salts are
not volatile, so this technique is less useful with a mass
spectrometer as a detector [6, 65].

Separation mechanism in HILIC mode
The mechanism and theoretical description of analyte retention in HPLC has been the subject of many articles. Different
research groups and scientific schools still disagree about the
most realistic retention mechanism and the best theory to
describe and predict it [66, 67].
There are essentially three possible ways to model the
separation mechanism. The first is analyte partitioning
between the mobile and stationary phases [68, 69]; the
second is the adsorption of the analyte onto the surface of
the adsorbent [70, 71]; the third assumes the preferential
adsorption of the organic mobile phase modifier onto the
adsorbent surface, followed by the partitioning of this
analyte into the adsorbed layer [72]. The retention
phenomenon in HPLC simultaneously depends on various
types of intermolecular interactions between the solute and
the stationary phase, the solute and the mobile phase, and
the stationary and mobile phases. Known intermolecular
interaction types are given in Table 2.

B. Buszewski, S. Noga

Present theory proposes that HILIC retention is caused
by partitioning. This phenomenon still lacks a thorough
theoretical explanation. In this mode, the separation
mechanism is based on the differential distribution of the
injected analyte solute molecules between the acetonitrile-rich
mobile phase and a water-enriched layer adsorbed onto the
hydrophilic stationary phase [6, 7] (see Fig. 3). The more
hydrophilic the analyte, the more the partitioning equilibrium
is shifted towards the immobilized water layer on the
stationary phase, and thus, the more the analyte is retained.
In other words, a separation based on the polarities of the
compounds and the degree of solvation takes place. As a result
of the preferential solvation of the stationary phase surface, it
is very likely that the gradient of a given solvent concentration
from the adsorbent surface into a bulk mobile phase is formed.
When the concentration of acetonitrile (or some other
organic solvent) increases, water interacts more strongly with
the surface of the polar stationary phase (e.g., bare silica). In
this case, acetonitrile cannot interact with residual silanols on
the stationary phases, so they are uncovered and water
molecules can be adsorbed onto them [74–78]. Figure 4a
shows the largest excess adsorption of acetonitrile on the
surface area of an HILIC adsorbent. It was found for waterrich mobile phases containing about 80% water by volume.
This mirrors the preferential adsorption of acetonitrile onto
siloxane bridges. The largest deficit of acetonitrile is found
for a water concentration of close to 20% (v/v). This
corresponds to the maximum excess adsorption of water onto
the silica, and illustrates the preferential adsorption of water
molecules onto free, accessible silanol groups (≡Si–OH) [79].
The water adsorption is higher when the proportion of water
molecules in the mobile phase decreases [78]. Figure 4b
shows the plots obtained when following the convention that
total adsorption isotherms have a horizontal plateau or rather
inflection point. This convention represents the minimum
adsorbed amount of eluent, because the total amount
adsorbed is a strictly monotonously increasing function of
its bulk concentration [79].
When the acetonitrile volume fraction is between 30 and
70%, the adsorbed phase consists of at least three adsorbed
layers of acetonitrile and water mixture. This agrees with
previous studies that demonstrated the formation of an
adsorbed multilayer of water on bare silica. The number of
adsorbed monolayers of pure acetonitrile is around 2, while
that of pure water is close to 3 [79].
To sum up, when the concentration of water in the mobile
phase is lower than 20%, water adsorption can be multilayer in
nature, and it can create an excess of adsorbed water in
comparison with the concentration of water in the eluent.
McCalley and Neue [78] concluded that about 4–13% of the
pore volume of the silica phase is occupied by a waterenriched layer when there is 75–90% acetonitrile in the
eluent. The solvent adsorption governed by these specific

Although it is well established that a hydrophilic surface
holds water when exposed to mixtures of organic solvent and
water, the HILIC partitioning theory is based on only
circumstantial evidence. HILIC is more than just simple
partitioning, and includes hydrogen donor interactions
between neutral polar species, as well as weak electrostatic
mechanisms under the high organic solvent conditions used

for retention. This indicates that the mechanism of HILIC is
distinct from that of ion-exchange chromatography. There are
studies that point towards a more multimodal separation
mechanism [6, 7]. Alpert [6] considered dipole–dipole
interactions, and hydrogen bonds may also contribute to
partitioning into the stationary phase layer. He noted charged
that basic groups in a solute lead to pronounced hydrophilicity and retention, so these interactions make important
contributions to the mechanism of separation. Yoshida [16]

238

Fig. 3 Schema of the separation mechanism in a HILIC system

similarly considered that HILIC retention encompassed both
hydrogen bonding (which depends on Lewis acidity/
basicity) and dipole–dipole interactions (dependent on
dipole moments and the polarizability of molecules).
It was shown the elution pattern was similar to that
in (nonaqueous) normal phase liquid chromatography, so
it was proposed that the mechanism must be similar too.
Hydrogen bonding, especially when using low-water
mobile phases, probably also contributes to the retention
mechanism in HILIC [80].
On the other hand, electrostatic interactions can play an
important role in HILIC, due to either ionic groups that have
been intentionally incorporated onto the stationary phase or
less intentional residual charges, such as those of dissociated
silanol groups [65]. These residual silanol groups on the

silica surface, which cannot be removed or blocked due to
steric effects of bonded ligands, are partially ionized.
Residual silanols may influence the separation of polar
analytes, especially basic compounds and biopolymers,
because of the strong polar (hydrogen-bonding and dipole–
dipole) interactions between their basic groups and the
ionized residual silanols of the support. Adsorbed water
molecules suppress the ionization of surface silanols, which
leads to negative charging of the silica gel surface. This layer
of negative charges on the silica gel surface creates a negative
electric field in the contacting mobile phase. Positive charges
attracted by the field create the second layer of the electric
double layer (Fig. 5) [81].
The interactions of basic and acidic analytes with the
stationary phase are expected to be based on both hydrophilic
interactions and electrostatic forces. However, the final
separation mechanism of the elution process is most probably
a superposition of partitioning and electrostatic interactions or
hydrogen bonding to the stationary phase [6, 7].
The extent to which each mechanism dominates is
dependent on the actual type of stationary phase used and
the buffer conditions, including the level and type of organic
solvent, the type and concentration of salt, and the pH [47].
Increasing the concentration of water in the eluent decreases
retention when—as is typical in HILIC—high acetonitrile
concentrations are used (Fig. 6) [10, 57]. Increasing the
admixture of an organic component in a partially aqueous
mobile phase generally leads to a decrease in the relative
static permittivity of the mixed mobile phase. This is indeed
the case with acetonitrile, the solvent typically used in HILIC.
Lower relative static permittivity is accompanied by decreased
ion stabilization, and this is manifested in increased pKa
values for solutes [65, 82]. Above 60% v/v acetonitrile,
strong deviations start to take place due to homo- and
heteroconjugation when the amount of water available to form
hydrogen bonds with the buffer compounds and solutes
decreases [65].
The presence of buffering salts in the mobile phase can
decrease electrostatic interactions through disruption [42, 65].

double layer on the stationary
bonded-phase surface. Based on
data from [81]

Additionally, the same salt-based disruption can decrease the
retentions of analytes, and can be useful during elution [6].
However, in some instances, a higher salt concentration
might drive the more solvated salt ions into the water-enriched
layer formed on the particles, yielding an increase in the
volume of the water layer and therefore an increase in
retention [42, 65, 84]. A thickening of the water layer on
the stationary phase through hydration takes place at the same
time [57]. Another possible cause has been hypothesized:
electrostatic repulsion between the stationary phase and the
analytes is weakened by the higher salt concentration [85].
Another factor that influences the retention characteristics
in HILIC is the pH of the buffer. Whether the buffer pH is
above or below the pKa of the analyte determines its charge
state, which in turn affects the hydrophilicity of the analyte
and likewise the interaction with the stationary phase [7, 33].
For example, acidic solutes had low retention or showed
exclusion in ammonium formate buffers, but were strongly

retained when trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) buffers were used.
This is possibly due to suppression of the repulsion of the
solute anions from ionized silanol groups at the low pH
values of TFA solutions of aqueous acetonitrile. At high
buffer pH, the ionization of weak bases was suppressed,
reducing ionic (and possibly hydrophilic) retention, leading
to further opportunities to manipulate selectivity [57].
Charged stationary phases, such as the above mentioned
anion or cation exchangers and deprotonated silanol groups,
are most likely to display some degree of electrostatic
interaction [7].
The effect of column temperature on HILIC separations
is often rather small (considerably less than in RP-LC), but
ultimately this depends on the nature of the retained
molecule [86]. The retention in the RP mode decreases at
increasing temperature and is principally controlled by the
enthalpic contribution. However, the retention factors in the
HILIC range of the mobile phase are almost independent of

columns. Adapted from the data in [83]

the temperature. In HILIC mode, the retention is probably
controlled by entropic contributions, possibly originating in
different levels of sample solvation in the stationary and
bulk mobile phases [87].
Polar analytes show very different selectivities under HILIC
and RP-LC conditions [88]. Sometimes polar compounds are
well retained, and the elution order in HILIC is one of
increasing hydrophilicity, which is roughly the reverse of that
seen in RP-LC. For example, Olsen [10] has compared the
properties of various stationary phases used for the separation
of pyrimidines and purines (polar compounds of significant
biological and pharmaceutical interest). Figure 7 shows
changes in the selectivity of the separation of these types of
polar compound on the HILIC and RP-LC columns.
It was demonstrated recently that the mechanism of
HILIC separation involves various combinations of hydrophilic interactions, ion exchange, and reversed-phase retention
by the siloxane on the silica surface, which contribute to
various degrees depending on the particular conditions
employed [33, 34].

Characterization and selection of HILIC separation
systems
The selectivity depends not only on the stationary phase but
also strongly on the mobile phase [89].
In reversed-phase systems, the effects of the volume
fraction of a strong organic solvent (φ) in a binary mobile
phase on the retention factor k over a limited concentration
range of acetonitrile–water can be described by a widely
used semi-empirical equation [90–93]:
log k ¼ log k0  m1  8 ¼ a  m  8 :

ð1Þ

The constant a in Eq. 1 should theoretically be equal to the
logarithm of the retention factor of the solute in pure water;

the constant m increases with decreasing polarity of the
organic solvent and with increasing size of the sample
molecule. Equation 1 was assumed to apply generally to the
systems where partition or nonlocalized adsorption controls
the retention, except for mobile phases with low concentrations of organic solvents. Because the retention in HILIC
is proportional to the polarity of the solute and inversely
proportional to the polarity of the mobile phase (opposite to
the retention in RP systems), Eq. 1 with φ taken to mean
the volume fraction of water rather than that of the organic
solvent can be used to describe the effects of the mobile
phase on the retention in HILIC systems, where the
partition between the adsorbed water and the bulk mobile
phase is assumed to control retention [94].
For conventional nonaqueous normal phase systems,
where retention is based on surface adsorption, the
following equation was found to adequately describe the
retention model [95, 96]:
0

0

log k ¼ log k0  m  log 8 ;

ð2Þ

where φ is the volume fraction of the polar solvent in the
binary organic mobile phase, k′0 is the retention factor in pure
polar solvent, and m is the stoichiometric coefficient characterizing the number of molecules of the strong solvent that are
needed to displace one adsorbed molecule of the analyte.
The relative polarity of the mobile phase with respect to the
stationary phase is a distinguishing feature that can be used to
classify NP and RP systems. Hence, a dual retention
mechanism, where the NP and RP effects contribute simultaneously to the retention, is a rather common phenomenon in
hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography [89].
The retention factor (k) includes the solvophobic and the
polar contributions, which depend on the polarity of the
solute, the chemistry of the stationary phase, and the
composition of the mobile phase [94]. Plots of retention
factor versus binary aqueous–organic mobile phase com-

position show a “U shape” [97, 98]. Minimum retention at
the “U turn” composition of the mobile phase corresponds
to the transition from the RP to the NP (HILIC in an
aqueous–organic mobile phase) mechanism, and the retention at this point is usually very low [94, 99]. The U shape
of k versus the volume fraction of an aqueous buffer φ
(BUF) can be described by the following equation:
log k ¼ a1 þ m1  8 ðBUFÞ  m2  log 8 ðBUFÞ:

ð3Þ

The parameters a1, m1 and m2 of Eq. 3 can be determined
by nonlinear regression of the experimental retention
factors measured for varying volume fractions of water in
the mobile phase. The parameter m1 characterizes the effect of
increasing the water concentration in the mobile phase on the
contribution of the RP mechanism to the retention, whereas
the parameter m2 is a measure of the opposite effect,
characteristic of the HILIC contribution to the retention in
highly organic mobile phases. a1 is an empirical constant [100].
To characterize the retention in liquid chromatography,
quantitative structure–retention relationships (QSRRs) are
widely used. QSRRs are the most extensively studied
manifestations of linear free-energy relationships (LFERs).
These are the statistically derived relationships that model the
analyte retention as a function of properties (descriptors)
related to the molecular structure of the analyte and the
physicochemical properties of both the stationary and mobile
phase [73]. Using the QSRR approach, the chromatographic
column can be regarded as a “free-energy transducer,”
translating differences in the chemical potentials of solutes
resulting from differences in their structures into the
chromatographic retention parameter [101]. The QSRR
method can assist in elucidating the molecular mechanism
for separation that occurs in a given chromatographic system,
and can aid in the optimization of this process [102]. QSRR
models can be used to characterize and compare the
suitability of columns for both RP [103] and HILIC
separations [104, 105]. Buszewski et al. [106] grouped
analytical columns based on the retention data for peptides.
They showed that different columns for RP-LC and HILIC
can be clearly distinguished using the QSRR method (Fig. 8).
Jandera et al. [99] investigated the retention of the antioxidants phenolic acid and flavone under HILIC and RP
conditions, and characterized the selectivities of various HILIC
systems using a linear solvation energy relationship model
with molecular structure descriptors.
The main problem with QSRR prediction models is that
the results are affected by the composition of the mobile
phase, which may become more or less adsorbed in the
stationary phase and thus change its true nature. Therefore,
comparing the properties of HILIC stationary phases in
order to predict the retention of polar compounds would be
probably more complicated than comparing RP columns
[73]. Additional study in this direction is necessary to show

Fig. 8 Comparison of columns through the cluster analysis of retention
data for peptide separation. Adapted from data in [106]

the real merits of the QSRR approach in HILIC. Possibly,
comparing the retention data, either isocratic or obtained in
gradient experiments with increasing salt and/or water concentration(s), may prove useful for the selection of appropriate
stationary–mobile phase combinations in HILIC of different
sample types [94].

Orthogonal and two-dimensional separations of HILIC
In 2D (LC×LC) (Fig. 9), the orthogonality between the two
dimensions is of paramount importance. It is generally
understood that a 2D separation is orthogonal if the two
separation mechanisms used are independent of each other
and show distinct retention profiles; or, in other words, they
provide different selectivities [107–110].
The concept and meaning of orthogonality is presented
schematically in Fig. 10 using practical examples of NP-LC×
RP-LC and RP-LC×RP-LC separations of lemon oil and
steroids, respectively. Low correlation (high orthogonality) is
observed in Fig. 10a, in which the compounds are randomly
distributed across the entire separation space, whereas there
is a high linear correlation for the separation shown in Fig. 10b.
In this case, the addition of an extra separation dimension
leads to an unnecessary increase in the complexity of the
system [112].
True orthogonality is technically difficult to achieve, as
orthogonality depends not only on the separation mechanisms
but also on the properties of the solutes and the separation
conditions. Successful orthogonal combinations can be
achieved when the appropriate stationary and mobile phases
are carefully chosen with respect to the physicochemical
properties of the sample constituents, including size, charge,
polarity, hydrophobicity, etc. A variety of stationary phases are
presently available, with differences in surface chemistries,

data in [111]

support material, carbon load, pore size, etc., whereas the
characteristics of the mobile phase can be altered by changing
the modifier, pH, temperature, or by adding ion pair agents.
These parameters play important roles in the mixed-mode
HILIC retention mechanism and can be flexibly tuned to suit
specific separation problems.

Because of its selectivity is highly complementary to RPLC, HILIC is ideally suited to 2D LC separations. Therefore,
an attractive feature of HILIC is its 2D separation capabilities
when used together with RP-LC [94, 99]. However, the highorganic mobile phases used in HILIC systems have very
high elution strengths in RP systems, and vice versa: mobile
phases with high concentrations of water (common in RP
systems) are very strong eluents in HILIC systems. This
causes serious problems when attempting to use on-line 2D
HILIC×RP-LC setups with direct fraction transfer via a
switching valve interface. The first-dimension mobile phase
in which the fractions are transferred to the second
dimension is an excessively strong eluent in the second
dimension, which often causes low resolution, peak asymmetry, and even split peaks in the second dimension [99].
For this reason, off-line setups are generally used in
HILIC×RP-LC systems, with trapping columns and/or
make-up flow post-column adjustment of the mobile-phase
elution strength employed [114], which is often timeconsuming and not very convenient. Another possibility for
orthogonal HILIC×RP separations on a single polar column
is to use repeated sample injection on a single column with
alternating gradients of increasing (RP) and decreasing
(HILIC) organic solvent concentration in the mobile phase
[99]. Figure 11 illustrates the concentration profile of ACN
in a sequence of 10 min alternating gradient runs over the full
range of mobile phase composition (HILIC with 100–0%
ACN and RP with 0–100% ACN), with 10 min equilibration
periods inserted between the alternating gradient runs.
It has been concluded on several occasions that compounds
which display large k values on HILIC are not well retained
by RP-LC and vice versa [112]. HILIC×RP-LC is the most
orthogonal combination of liquid separation techniques when

from the data in [99]

orthogonality is defined as the fraction of coverage of a 2D
separation space [115]. The benefits of the orthogonality of
HILIC×RP-LC can also be utilized by running the same
sample in both HILIC and RP-LC modes and combining the
data. This provides more information on the total sample and
can, for example, be used for enhanced protein identification
via database searches or in approaches with sample fingerprint
analysis. For example, selected LC modes including RP-LC
and HILIC were combined in different 2D LC setups for the
separation of the natural antioxidants phenolic acid and
flavone (Fig. 12) by Jandera et al. [116].
Other examples are the separation of peptides in 2005
by Gilar et al. [115], and of flavonoid glycosides in both
RP-LC and HILIC modes on a β-cyclodextrin column by
Feng et al. in 2010 [46]. 2D techniques combining RP and
HILIC chromatography represent powerful tools in the
analysis of pharmaceuticals and their degradation products,
and in the metabolic profiling of physiological fluids [61].

Two-dimensional liquid chromatography is often used to
reduce the complexity of a proteomic sample prior to tandem
mass spectrometry analysis.
An elegant way to utilize the advantageous orthogonality
of HILIC and RP-LC is to use solid-phase extraction (SPE)
to fractionate the sample before separation. The two
fractions are then separated in either the HILIC or the RPLC mode, depending on the polarity [34]. Other techniques,
such as IC and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), result
in more peak grouping or poorer resolution in comparison
to HILIC [115].

Applications of HILIC
There are many examples of the application of HILIC to the
analysis of small polar molecules, including biomarkers,
nucleosides, nucleotides/oligonucleotides, amino acids,

peptides and proteins, saccharides, glycosides, oligosaccharides, hydrophilic drugs, alkaloids, carbohydrates, and
other small polar or ionizable compounds, which contribute
to the fields of pharmaceutical chemistry, proteomics,

metabolomics, glycomics, medical science, agricultural
and food chemistry. The HILIC mode is used intensively
to separate some biomolecules through differences in
polarity, as well as organic and some inorganic molecules.

HILIC—a powerful separation technique

Its popularity has increased due to the simple biological
sample preparation employed when looking for metabolites,
since the metabolic process generally results in the addition of
polar groups to enhance elimination from the cellular tissue.
Table 3 shows several examples of applications of HILIC
systems.
HILIC separations are very easy to combine with
several detection techniques, such as ultraviolet light
absorbance (UV), fluorescence (FL), refractive index
(RI), evaporative light scattering (ELSD), charged aerosol (CAD), and mass spectrometry (MS) [127–129]. In
addition it is ideally suited to the sensitive LC-MS
analysis of water-soluble polar compounds, because the
high organic content in the mobile phase leads to rapid
evaporation of the solvent during electrospray ionization.
HILIC can offer a tenfold increase in sensitivity over
reversed-phase chromatography because the organic solvent is much more volatile.
Concluding remarks
Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in HILIC.
More versatile and diverse stationary phases have become
available, leading to reports of an exciting and broad range
of applications. The unique separation ability of HILIC and
its orthogonality towards RP make it an ideal method for
multidimensional chromatography, which can extend separation power. As far as selectivity is concerned, HILIC can
complete well with RP, which is one of the main
chromatographic techniques applied today.
Its applications now encompass most categories of polar
compounds, charged as well as uncharged, although HILIC is
particularly well suited to solutes that lack charge (meaning
that Coulombic interactions cannot be used to mediate
retention). This approach has recently gained a great deal of
attention because of the increased need to analyze polar
compounds in complicated mixtures. Another reason for its
popularity is the widespread use of MS coupled to HPLC, as
HILIC mobile phases are very compatible and give high
sensitivity. Recently, HILIC has found great popularity in
bioanalytical applications because drugs and their metabolites
are often polar structures.
