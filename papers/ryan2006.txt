Metabolomics: The Greatest Omics of Them All?

Is metabolomics the greatest “omics” of all? Certainly, it has
been suggested that metabolomics may in fact provide the most
“functional” information of the omics technologies.1 This reflects
the limitations associated with transcriptomics and proteomics;
for example, changes in the transcriptome and proteome do not
always result in altered biochemical phenotypes (the metabolome).1,2 Furthermore, the metabolome represents the final “omic”
level in a biological system, and metabolites represent functional
entities, unlike messenger RNA molecules, which constitute the
transcriptome.3 Metabolites thus have a clear function in the life
of the biological system and are also contextual,3 reflecting the
surrounding environment. The metabolome can thus be thought
of as a looking glass, which if looked through can show information concerning the physiological, developmental, and pathological
status of a biological system.
Terminology relating to metabolomics has been controversial.4
The term “metabolome” was first used by Olivier et al. in 19985
to describe the set of metabolites synthesized by an organism, in
a fashion analogous to that of the genome and proteome. This
definition has been limited6 to “the quantitative complement of
all of the low molecular weight molecules present in cells in a
particular physiological or developmental state”. Metabolomics
was coined by Fiehn7 and defined as a comprehensive analysis in
which all metabolites of a biological system were identified and
quantified.
Much of the confusion related to terminology arises from the
similar “metabonomics”, since the two terms are often used
interchangeably. Furthermore, metabonomics has been described
as a subset of metabolomics,8 yet metabolomics can also be
thought of as a subset of systems covered by metabonomics3 cited
in ref 9. The two fields employ similar methodologies and have a

common goal of analyzing the metabolome. Hence, technologies
will often be translatable across both fields. However, both
precedence and the bulk of the literature support use of the term
metabolomics to describe a comprehensive analytical approach
that is nonselective and universally applicable to identify and
quantify all metabolites of a biological system without size
restriction on the analyte.
Metabolomics: Is It or Isn’t It? Analysis of metabolites is
not a new field; but historically it has been limited to relatively
small numbers of target analytes as in studies of glycolysis or
respiration. However, the realization that metabolic pathways do
not act in isolation but rather as part of an extensive network has
led to the need for a more holistic approach to metabolite analysis.
This is illustrated in Figure 1, which compares the traditional linear
view of a metabolic pathway with the holistic network model.
Metabolite analysis is complicated by the number of analytes, their
diversity, and dynamic ranges. It is estimated that the metabolome
extends over 7-9 magnitudes of concentration (pmol-mmol),10
and the number of metabolites in the plant system alone is

estimated to exceed 200 000.11 Of more relevance and significance
is the number and diversity of analytes likely to be encountered
in a single system. We are in unknown territory here, but if we
consider a system comprising x metabolites characterized by the
substrate concentrations, S1, S2, ..., Sx and y fluxes characterized
by the rate constants, k1, k2, ...., ky involved in z pathways, where
x may be typically 2000-5000 and z may be 20-50, we have some
idea of the enormity of the task. This is illustrated in Figure 1 for
a simple system involving five substrates, six fluxes, and a single
pathway. A complete characterization of this system involves
measurement of five concentrations and six rate constants, not
all of which can be determined at any one time. The flavonoids
illustrate the analytical problems associated with diversity. These
commonly occur in glycosidic linkage with 5-10 sugars being
commonly involved. The number of known flavonoids now
exceeds 5000, leading to a possible 50 000 unique metabolites.
For example, more than 200 different aglycons conjugated to
glucose have been identified in grapes of Vitis vinifera.12 Thus, a
successful analytical approach in metabolomics must be capable
of accurately measuring numerous known and unknown compounds that span a diverse chemical spectrum and a large dynamic
concentration range. Sample preparation procedures and methods
of quantification cannot yet meet these demands.
Historical approaches to metabolite analysis include metabolite
profiling, metabolite fingerprinting, and target analysis. Metabolite
fingerprinting aims to rapidly classify numerous samples using
multivariate statistics, typically without differentiation of individual
metabolites or their quantitation. Target analysis is constrained
exclusively to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of a
particular metabolite or metabolites. As a result, only a very small
fraction of the metabolome is focused upon, signals from all other
components being ignored.13 Metabolite profiling involves the
identification and quantitation by a particular analytical procedure
of a predefined set of metabolites of known or unknown identity
and belonging to a selected metabolic pathway.7,10 By their nature,
these approaches provide a restrictive noncomprehensive view
of the metabolome. Nevertheless, metabolite profiling represents
the oldest and most established approach and can be considered
the precursor for metabolomics.
The analysis of biophenols in olives using high-performance
liquid chromatography with UV detection14 is an example of
profiling that involves a predefined set of metabolites from a single
metabolic pathway. It illustrates the notion of dependence of
metabolite profiles on detection method in that different profiles
are generated at different detection wavelengths. The use of
universal detection such as evaporative light scattering or refractive index or mass spectrometry eliminates some but not all of
this dependence. Further method dependency is related to the
column in both gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) in that it acts as a “filter” and not all components
injected are necessarily eluted. However, it is sample procurement
and sample preparation15 that present the most significant restriction in relation to the need for universality and nonselectivity in

metabolomics, and yet, sample handling has received much less
attention in the literature than the more glamorous steps of the
analysis that involve application of sophisticated instrumentation.
Many studies have concluded that biological variation is much
higher than that associated with the analytical technique,16
emphasising the need for large numbers of replicates and standard
sampling methods. This applies even to samples at seemingly
identical developmental stage grown under highly controlled
environmental conditions.
Composite metabolite profiling in which separate technology
platforms are used to assess different sets of metabolites belonging
to different metabolic pathways is one possible approach to
metabolomics. Are the individual profiles additive and does the
composite profile equate to the metabolome? Indeed, the need to
detect as many metabolites as possible in a single analysis has
been noted.17 The major limitation of composite profiling is largely
temporal in that simultaneous high-throughput analyses of large
numbers of metabolites are not generally feasible. As the metabolome is dynamic, this time factor may introduce artifactual
problems. The very process of metabolite extraction must disturb
the status quo of an organism, and chemical changes brought
about by exposure to oxygen, solvents, and change of pH are
particularly common. Thus, the metabolites isolated from natural
sources are not necessarily the metabolites that are present in
the living tissue. Moreover, the level of metabolites at any given
time represents a composite of both catabolic and anabolic
processes and presents a snapshot of the metabolome at that
particular time only. Of course, this can be an advantage as timedependent snapshot sampling will reveal directed correlations of
metabolic processes.18
Many authors claim to be undertaking metabolomics research,
but are these claims sustainable? Using the accepted definition
of metabolomics as our starting point, Table 1 compares some
recent papers against the criteria required for metabolomics.
Papers were selected solely for their use of the term metabolomics
in the title, and their inclusion is not intended as a criticism but
rather as an acknowledgment of the complexity of the problem.
The inability to achieve metabolomics is apparent, and the term
metabolome analysis is often used as an alternative. Simple plants

and yeasts with defined genomes have been widely used in
metabolome analyses. These simple systems avoid the complications in analyte extraction that arise with increased plant complexity as, for example, with fruits, oily plants, and seeded plants with
distinct compartments where analyte compartmentalization becomes a consideration. Arabidopsis thaliana is an example of a
model plant species19,20 chosen for its simplicity and for which
the complete genome sequence and functional gene annotations
are publicly available.
As an example of a typical qualitative analysis using a simple
system, extracts of A. thaliana were separated on C18 monolithic
silica capillary columns coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry.21
Mass spectral deconvolution software led to the detection of over
700 base peaks. Even if many of the low-intensity base peaks were
attributable to reagent impurities or contamination, the number
of real metabolites still exceeded several hundred. The authors
claimed good coverage of the plant lipophilic and secondary
metabolome although carotenes were not detectable by ESI and
required UV-visible detection. In another study, over 300 polar
metabolites were identified in A. thaliana leaf by GC/MS2 in a
single extract. However, the discrepancy between the number of
genes and the number of known reactions catalyzed by encoded
enzymes has inevitably led to the conclusion that there remain
many as yet unidentified metabolites.22 Mass spectral signals could
not be deconvoluted sufficiently to estimate the actual number of
metabolites detected in Arabidopsis.22

Weckwerth et al.23 developed a novel extraction protocol
whereby hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites, proteins and RNA
were sequentially extracted from the same A. thaliana sample
(Table 2). Hydrophilic and lipophilic metabolites were derivatized
and analyzed by gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF MS) (Figure 2). The authors detected 652
metabolites and 297 proteins and clear RNA bands using this
procedure. Detection of this number and diversity of metabolites
using a single-platform technology is exceptional. What is more
interesting from our perspective is what was not detected, namely,
cell debris plus insoluble material from each partitioning step in
the procedure. We can only guess at the number of undetected
metabolites in this rejected material.
Why Persist? Given that metabolomics is not achievable with
the current state of development in analytical science, why persist?
There are many reasons apart from the simple desire to enhance
our knowledge base, and the hype surrounding metabolomics
stems from its incredible potential to contribute in diverse areas.
It is this potential that continues to drive research in the field.
Decoding the metabolome will impact on a multitude of areas, a
few of which are discussed below.
The chemical diversity of the metabolome offers major opportunities for the discovery of novel drugs and bioactive
molecules. This will have a significant impact on human health
through the development of new medicines and “functional foods”.
The latter is directly related to the emerging field of nutrigenomics, which studies how specific genes and bioactive food components interact.24 Nutrigenomics has the potential to enable
individualized diets by prescribing particular functional foods.

on functional foods, nutraceuticals, and dietary supplements,25 the
global impact of nutrigenomics is considerable. Further recognition to the importance of metabolomics in human health is
evidenced by the establishment of two metabolomic themes in
2004 by the National Institute of Health (NIH, USA).26
Metabolomics represents a way to dissect and modify plant
metabolism, physiology, and development.27 Such capabilities are
essential for breeding more robust plant varieties that are disease
resistant. Metabolomics will enable the disease status of plants
to be better defined through the identification of disease biomarkers and the role of environmental conditions and stresses
on plant productivity to be ascertained. The economic ramifications
associated with these tasks cannot be underestimated.
Food quality is directly dependent on metabolome composition.
For example, poor-quality wheat cannot intrinsically produce highquality bread. Food authenticity is also related to food quality,
particularly with respect to adulteration, for example, when
expensive vegetable oils are adulterated with cheap oil. This
process represents a major economic fraud, which can have severe
health implications depending upon the nature of the adulterant.
Metabolomics facilitates product fingerprinting, which is critical
for the detection and prevention of adulteration.
Functional genomics, as the name implies, aims to decipher
gene function by establishing a better understanding of the
correlation between genes and the functional phenotype of an
organism.28 Since the metabolome of a system represents the
amplification and integration of signals from other functional
genomic levels (e.g., transcriptome and proteome),29 metabolomics
can be considered tool for functional genomics. Functional
genomics represents a way to do “smarter” genomics, rather than
simply gene mapping and sequencing, and motivation for this
research endeavor arises because of the large proportion of open
reading frames (typically 20-40%30) in a fully sequenced organism
that have no known function at the biochemical and phenotype
levels. Such genes are referred to as “silent” or “orphan” genes.
In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, around 6000
protein encoding genes exist; however, there are less than 600
low molecular weight intermediate metabolites (cited in ref 3).

Determining gene function can be achieved through metabolite
profiling of specific genetically altered organisms. These metabolite profiles may then be compared to that of a “control” organism
to yield information about the metabolic consequence of the
altered genome31 and ultimately assign gene function. This
approach was first used by Roessner et al.,16 whereby several
potato tuber transgenic lines, modified in either sugar or starch
metabolism, were compared. Based upon their observed results,
the authors deemed metabolite profiling to be an important tool
for characterizing the metabolic status of a plant with respect to
environmental, developmental, or genetic factors. This is in
accordance with Fiehn, who theorized that it should be possible
to ultimately link metabolomic changes to the underlying genetic
alterations.8 Metabolomics thus has the potential to enable the
phenotype of silent mutations to be mapped29 and gene function
to be assigned to the many poorly or unanoted genes.31
Systems biology uses an approach similar to that of functional
genomics, but has significantly greater aims than the latter.
Systems biology represents the ultimate challenge in that is aims
to integrate genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics32 for a global understanding of biological systems. In
essence, systems biology looks at the big picture to obtain a better
understanding of how individual pathways or metabolic networks
are related. Systems biology does not investigate individual genes,
proteins, or metabolites one at a time, but rather investigates the
behavior and relationships of all the elements in a particular
biological system while it is functioning.33 The general systems
biology approach is a perturbation of the system (biologically,
genetically, or chemically), followed by monitoring the impact of
the perturbation at the genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic
levels. These omic data can then be integrated and ultimately
modeled computationally for a complete understanding of system
functioning. The potential impact of systems biology is enormous,
ranging from metabolite engineering1 to reshaping medicine
toward predictive, preventative, and personalized prevention of
cellular dysfunction and disease.34 What must be realized is that

development in analytical science is improved sensitivity and
selectivity/specificity in recognition of current instrumental limitations. However, success in metabolomics requires that we reverse
this approach and employ nonselective universal procedures
where specificity is achieved temporally rather than spatially by
extension of existing multidimensional platforms. In vivo analysis
of intact samples is an attractive proposition, and in this context,
NMR-based technologies have a distinct advantage over other
analytical techniques.36,37 However, as noted by Weckwerth,18

better understanding of the intricate biochemical processes and
their scattering in living systems.”
