Abstract
Procedures are described to recover and determine intermediary metabolites in Aspergillus
m&r. The methods involve
rapid quenching of meta.bolism by direct transfer of a culture sample from a bioreactor to a buffered solution containing 60%
methanol at -45°C. Metabolites do not leak from the cells when this sampling technique is used. Following quenching, the
mycelium is collected by filtration and washed if required. Extraction of metabolites at -20°C and neutral pH using
chloroform to permeabilise the cells prevents degradation of labile metabolites. An internal standard (xylitol) is used to

correct for extraction recovery which was approximately 80%. To calculate actual intracellular concentrations, the
intracellular volume has, been determined. A value of 1.2 ml/g of dry weight was obtained for the growth conditions used.
This method is suitable to determine the levels of glycolytic intermediates in Aspergillus
niger mycelium. Although the
measured levels were, in general, similar to values published previously and obtained by various other methods, the
advantage of the procedure described here is that all metabolites can be assayed in a single extract.

1. Introduction
In studies on metabolic
regulation,
often the
approach is taken to just investigate the kinetic and
regulatory characteristics of enzymes in vitro. However, the physiological relevance of regulatory mechanisms deduced from experiments
with isolated
enzyme systems can only be assessed when the in
vivo concentrations of substrates, products and effectors are also known. In other words, knowledge
about the concentrations
of intermediary metabolites
is required to determine the factors that control
metabolic fluxes in vivo.
The methods used for sampling of biomass and

extraction of metabolites from the cells should be
designed in such a way that the experimental values
obtained for metabolite
levels reflect those truly
existing in vivo [ 1,2]. For instance, the turnover of
intermediary
metabolites is usually high. Thus, an
important requirement
of such a method is that
cellular metabolism
is quenched
instantaneously
upon sampling. In addition, the conditions used for
extraction should not lead to conversions
of the
metabolites of interest. Recently an elegant method
that satisfies these conditions
was developed for
Succharomyces
cerevisiae
[3]. These experiments
involve rapid quenching of metabolism by spraying
yeast cells in a cold methanol-water
mixture and
extraction of metabolites from the cells at neutral
PH.

lites has been frequently reported for yeast, little is
known about metabolite levels in filamentous fungi.
This is surprising in view of the biotechnological
relevance of filamentous fungi in the production of
primary and secondary metabolites
and proteins.
Regarding primary metabolites, a well known example is citric acid production by Aspergillus niger. A
high rate of citric acid accumulation by this fungus
depends on a high glycolytic flux [4]. By investigating the factors which control the glycolytic flux,
rational optimisation of the process may be obtained.
To this end and to facilitate studies on metabolic
regulation in filamentous fungi in general, we developed a methodology
for the determination
of
intermediary metabolites in Aspergillus niger based
on the procedures described for yeast. In this report,
the method and some experiments that establish the
validity of the results are described.

2. Materials

and methods

2.1. Materials
HPLC-grade methanol was used since methanol of
technical quality occasionally gave turbid solutions
when mixed with water. Other chemicals were of
analytical grade and obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Fructose 2,6-diphosphate
and sulphate-free preparations of aldolase, triosephosphate
isomerase, glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase
and
pyrophosphate-dependent
phosphofructokinase
used
in the kinetic determination
of fructose 2,6-diphosphate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
USA). All other enzymes and biochemicals
were
obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany).
2.2. Strains and culture conditions
Aspergillus niger NW131 (cspA1, goxCI7) was
used in all experiments.
Conidiospores
were harvested from complete medium [5] solidified with
1.5% (w/v) agar and containing
50 mM glucose.
Mycelia were cultured for 48 h at 30°C in a defined
medium
containing
0.5
g KH,PO,,
2.5 g
(NH,),SO,,
0.25 g MgSO;7H,O,
6.5 mg FeSO,.
7H,O,
1.3 mg ZnSO,*7H,O,
0.15 ml polypropyleneglycol
and 140 g of glucose per litre using

Methods 25 (1996) 295-302

3-litre fermenters
(Applikon,
Schiedam,
Netherlands). After 48 h of culturing, the mycelia were in
the late exponential growth phase. The culture pH
was not regulated and decreased from an initial value
of 3.5 to approximately 2 at the moment of sampling.
Cultures were sparged with 0.2 vvm air, while
addition of pure oxygen was used to keep the
dissolved oxygen tension above 50% air saturation.
2.3. Sampling

of mycelium

A 25-ml sample (containing approximately
200
mg of mycelial dry weight) was transferred directly
from the fermenter vessel into 100 ml of a solution
containing 60% (v/v) methanol and 200 mM triethanolamine,
pH 7.3, which was precooled to
-45°C in a cooling bath (B. Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany). Following sampling, the sample
temperature was approximately
-20°C.
The residence time in the sample tubing (i.d., 5 mm; total
length, approximately 1 m) was approximately 1 s. A
short residence time is important to prevent changes
in the conditions as present in the bioreactor during
sampling. After 5-10 min of further cooling in a
stirred ethanol bath at -45°C
mycelia were collected by vacuum filtration on a sintered glass funnel
(pore size 40-100 pm) and washed 3 times with 100
ml of a solution containing 50% (v/v) methanol and
50 mM triethanolamine,
pH 7.3, precooled
to
-45°C.
Mycelium
samples were either extracted
immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -70°C.
2.4. Extraction

of metabolites

Unless stated otherwise, all further manipulations
were performed at -45°C.
A mycelium
sample
obtained as described above was transferred to a tube
and resuspended in 6 ml of methanol. To each tube,
15 ,umol xylitol was added as an internal standard.
Following
addition of 10 ml of chloroform
and
mixing, samples were incubated for 30 min to allow
permeabilisation
of cells and denaturation
of enzymes. Subsequently 4 ml of 5 mM triethanolamine,
pH 7.2, kept at 0°C was added, followed by
vigorous mixing and a further lo-min incubation to
cool the samples. To accomplish efficient extraction
of metabolites from the cells the tubes were shaken

G.J.G. Ruijrer, J. Visser / Journal

of Microbiological Methods 25 (1996) 295-302

for 30 min at -20°C (in a commercial type freezer)
at 1800 rpm on an IKA Vibrax VXR shaker (Janke
and Kunkel, Staufen, Germany) using a universal
holder. The water-methanol
and chloroform phases
were separated by centrifugation
at 5OOOXg for 5
min at -20°C (mycelium collects at the interface).
The water-methanol
phase (supematant) containing
the extracted metabolites was taken off and transferred to another tube. The mycelium
was then
extracted a second time by adding 2 ml of methanol,
mixing, and 2 ml of 5 mM triethanolamine
pH 7.2
(0°C) followed by vigorous mixing. Following centrifugation, the supematant fraction was added to the
first extract. To the combined extracts, 15 ml of
diethylether was added. After mixing and centrifugation at 1OOOXg for 5 minutes at -20°C the diethylether was removed. Samples were then frozen in
liquid nitrogen and concentrated from approximately
12 to 1.5 ml by evaporation under vacuum using a
Speedvac (Savant Inslruments, Hicksville, NY, USA)
without additional heating. The exact volume of the
extracts was then determined and the extracts were
centrifuged briefly at 4°C to remove possible insoluble material.
The extracted
mycelium
was collected
and
lyophilised
to determine
the dry weight of the
sample. The dry weight of a mycelium sample did
not decrease significantly by extraction.
Xylitol, used as internal standard, was measured
with high performance anion-exchange
chromatography (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using isocratic
elution with 0.48 M NaOH on a CarboPac MA1
column.
2.5. Determination

of metabolites

Analyses were performed on a Cobas Bio (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) autoanalyser that was connected
to a computer for data logging. The data-logging and
data-analysis
programs were those used by De
Koning and Van Dam [3].
Metabolites
were determined
essentially
as described by Bergmeyer [6] in 50 mM triethanolamine,
5 mM MgCl,, pH 7.6, unless stated otherwise.
Where possible, a number of metabolites
were
assayed in one samplle aliquot in the order given.
Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), fructose 6-phosphate
(F6P) and ATP were determined in the presence of

297

0.5 mM NADP+ by addition of 0.3 U/ml glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase, 2.8 U/ml phosphoglucose
isomerase and 2.2 U/ml hexokinase+ 1 mM glucose,
respectively.
Dihydroxyacetonephosphate
(DHAP),
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and fructose 1,6-diphosphate (F1,6DP) were determined in the presence of
0.2 mM NADH by the addition of 0.7 U/ml
glycerol-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase,
40 U/ml triosephosphate
isomerase and 0.1 U/ml
aldolase,
respectively.
Pyruvate,
phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP), 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) and 3-phosphoglycerate
(3PG)
were determined in the presence of 0.2 mM NADH
and 100 mM KC1 by addition of 1.1 U/ml lactate
dehydrogenase, 0.8 U/ml pyruvate kinase+0.8
mM
ADP, 3.2 U/ml enolase and 20 U/ml phosphoglycerate mutase+40 yM 2,3-diphosphoglycerate,
respectively.
ADP and AMP were determined in the presence of
0.2 mM NADH, 100 mM KC1 and 1.1 U/ml lactate
dehydrogenase
by addition of 0.8 U/ml pyruvate
kinase+0.4 mM PEP and 5.6 U/ml myokinase+0.2
mM ATP, respectively.
NADH was determined in the presence of 0.5 mM
DHAP by the addition of 0.7 U/ml glycerol-3phosphate dehydrogenase. NAD+ was determined in
4X diluted glycine buffer reagent (Sigma, no. 332-9)
in the presence of 250 mM ethanol by the addition of
36 U of alcohol dehydrogenase per ml.
Fructose 2,6-diphosphate
(F2,6DP)
was determined using a kinetic assay as described by Van
Schaftingen et al. [7]. The assay mixture contained
50 mM Tris pH 8.1, 2.5 mM MgCl,, 0.2 mM
NADH, 0.75 mM fructose 6-phosphate,
17 mM
glucose 6-phosphate, 0.05 U/ml pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase,
0.5 U/ml aldolase, 25
U/ml triosephosphate isomerase, 2.2 U/ml glycerol3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Samples containing
O-20 nM fructose
2,6-diphosphate were included in measuring series to
calculate the fructose 2,6-diphosphate content of the
metabolite extracts.
2.6. intracellular

volume

The intracellular
volume was determined as described for Neurospora crassa [8] using xylitol as a

G.J.G. Ruijter, J. Visser / Journal of Microbiological Methods 25 (1996) 295-302

298

probe. Solid xylitol was added to a 25ml culture
sample to a final concentration of approximately 50
mM. After 10 min of incubation, the mycelium was
collected on a sintered glass funnel. A sample was
taken from the filtrate to determine the exact starting
concentration
of xylitol (concentration
Fl ) by high
performance
anion-exchange
chromatography.
Following measurement of the wet weight (WW) of the
mycelium, the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of
water and incubated
for 10 min. After another
filtration step the dry weight (DW) of the mycelium
was determined after lyophilisation
and the xylitol
concentration
was measured in the second filtrate
(concentration
F2). The intracellular
volume was
calculated as ml/g dry weight according to the
following equation in which WW and DW are in
grams and using a value of 1 g/ml for the density of
water:
Intracellular

volume =

(WW - DW - 50*F2/Fl)/DW

3. Results
3. I. Determination

of metabolites

With the methods employed,
most glycolytic
metabolites could be measured without difficulty in
Aspergillus niger extracts. A few exceptions were
glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate, which is unstable and
decomposes
rapidly, and 2-phosphoglycerate
and
NADH, for which the levels were always very low in
our Aspergillus niger samples.
The lowest metabolite concentration that could be
determined routinely in a concentrated extract was
2-3 PM, which is equivalent to approximately 0.02
pmollg
dry weight (the kinetic assay used for
fructose 2,6-diphosphate allows determination of 10
nM F2,6DP in a concentrated
extract). Standard
deviations were generally lo-20% of the measured
values, but were higher for metabolites that were
present at low concentrations
in the cells.
3.2. Sampling

method

To quench cellular metabolism rapidly, a sample
of an Aspergillus
niger culture was transferred

directly to a solution containing 60% methanol and
200 mM triethanolamine
pH 7.3 precooled
to
-45°C. The use of cold methanol for quenching has
been developed for yeast [2,3], but due to strong
acidification of the culture medium by Aspergillus
niger a buffered methanol solution had to be used in
this case to prevent degradation
of acid labile
metabolites.
Following
quenching,
the mycelia were either
collected by centrifugation
or filtration, both at low
temperature. When centrifugation was used to collect
mycelia from the samples, the amounts of dihydroxyacetonephosphate
and ATP extracted were 3080% lower than the amounts obtained with filtration
(data not shown). In addition, the amounts of ADP
and AMP were higher with centrifugation. With the
available equipment,
a suboptimal temperature
of
- 10 to -5°C could be maintained during centrifugation. Since the temperature could be kept lower
during filtration (below -20°C)
we interpreted the
observed differences as a phosphatase activity that
could be inhibited by extremely low temperatures.
Therefore, filtration was used to collect mycelium.
Possible leakage of metabolites from the cells was
checked by measuring the amount of the various
metabolites
both in the cells and in the filtrate
directly following
sampling and after a 30-min
incubation of the sample at -45°C.
None of the
metabolites could be detected in significant amounts
in the filtrates (Table 1). Furthermore, the metabolite
levels in the cells were independent of the residence
time at -45°C following quenching. Variation in the
number of wash steps (O-5 times) also did not affect
the metabolite levels (data not shown). These observations indicate that the metabolites determined
did not leak from the cells after quenching of culture
samples in 60% methanol at -45°C.
In addition, the constant level of metabolites in the
cells verifies the effectiveness of the sampling method in sufficiently stopping metabolism.
3.3. Extraction

method

Due to the filamentous morphology of the fungus,
quantitative removal of the water-methanol
phase
after extraction was difficult. With two subsequent
extraction steps an acceptable, but not quantitative,
extraction recovery could be obtained. To correct for

Fifty millilitres of an Aspwgillus niger culture was sampled into 200 ml of a solution containing 60% (v/v) methanol and 200 mM
triethanolamine
(pH 7.3) precooled to -45°C. Mycelia were collected by filtration from 125-ml portions either directly (approximately
1
min after sampling) or following a 30.min incubation at -45°C and extracted as described in Materials and methods. The sample filtrates
were concentrated under vacuum from 125 to IO ml. Metabolites were assayed in extracts and filtrates as described in Materials and methods
and expressed as nmollml culture to facilitate direct comparison between extracellular
and intracellular concentrations.
The column
‘Culture’ gives the metabo.lite concentrations
present in culture filtrate at the time of sampling. The detection limits are 0.2 nmol/ml for
extracts and 1.0 nmollml for sample filtrates and culture filtrate. Negative values can occur due to baseline drift.

extraction recovery xylitol was added at the start of
each extraction as an internal standard. The recovery
of xylitol was 8 1?4?& (va1uekS.D.; n =4) when two
extraction steps were performed. Introduction
of a
third extraction step improved the recovery slightly
(89?3%
(value+S.D.;
n =4)), but increased the
volume of the extract leading to a longer time
required for concentmtion
of the extract. Therefore
we routinely applied two extraction steps and used
xylitol as an internal standard.
A test was performed to check whether the use of
low temperature was sufficient to block metabolism
during extraction of the cells. For a number of
glycolytic
metabolites
added at the start of an
extraction the recovery was 73-81%, values similar
to that obtained for xylitol (Table 2). This result
indicates that not more than 10% and usually less, of
the metabolites was lost due to conversions during
extraction.

3.4. Intracellular

concentrations

of metabolites

To enable calculation of actual intracellular concentrations a conversion factor relating dry weight to
the intracellular
volume was determined. With an
intracellular volume of 1.2050.15 ml/g dry weight
(va1ueZS.D.;
n= 13) concentrations
of glycolytic
intermediates were calculated for Aspergillus niger
cultured 48 h on a medium designed for citric acid
production (Table 3).

4. Discussion
Knowledge about the intracellular concentrations
of intermediary metabolites is essential when regulation of metabolic pathways is studied quantitatively.
In this report, we describe a method to determine
intermediary metabolites in Aspergillus niger which

Procedures
for culturing Aspergillus niger and for sampling,
extraction and determination of metabolites are given in Materials
and methods. For the extracted metabohtes,
intracellular
concentrations were calculated using a conversion factor of 1.2 ml/g
dry weight. The values are given with standard deviations and are
averages of 5 extracts.
“Fructose-2,6-diphosphate

is based on procedures developed for yeast [3]. The
method involves rapid quenching of metabolism by
sampling in cold methanol followed by extraction of
metabolites from the cells at neutral pH. A few tests
indicated
that no changes in metabolite
levels
occurred due to leakage from the cells upon sampling, whereas changes due to conversions
during
sampling or extraction were minimal and not exceeding 10%. The tests described here were all performed
on mycelia cultured for 48 h, but in other experiments the validity of the results was also established
for both younger and older mycelia.
In pilot experiments
the extraction method described here, using chloroform at neutral pH, was
compared to procedures frequently described in the
literature using either acid or alkaline treatments. For
a number of glycolytic intermediates (e.g., F2,6DP,
DHAP, PEP) the chloroform method appeared to be
superior to both extraction with perchloric acid and
KOH, since larger amounts of these metabolites were
extracted. This is probably due to instability of these
metabolites at both high and low pH.

G.J.G. Ruijter, J. Visser I Journal of Microbiological Methods 25 (1996) 295-302

Using fast quenching of metabolism by sampling
in cold methanol, De Koning and Van Dam [3]
described experiments in which they studied changes
in the levels of glycolytic intermediates in yeast on a
subsecond
time scale. The morphology
of filamentous fungi is likely to cause specific problems in
such experiments
due to high viscosity or nonhomogeneous
incubation mixtures. We did not test
the possibilities to perform experiments with Aspergillus niger at the same time-scale. In this study, the
method is used to determine steady-state levels of
glycolytic
intermediates
in citric acid producing
Aspergillus niger. No extensive analysis is presented
here, but work is in progress using the techniques
described to investigate the glycolytic flux in relation
to citric acid production by this fungus. For most of
the glycolytic metabolites determined here the intracellular concentrations
obtained are similar to the
few values published for citric acid producing Aspergillus niger. Values for fructose 2,6-diphosphate
determined by Kubicek-Pranz
et al. [9] are nearly
identical to the values measured here. Fuhrer et al.
[lo] determined NAD+ and NADH and found high
levels of NADH compared to our results. The
extraction procedure used by these authors has been
checked thoroughly and does not appear to give
erroneous results. One reason for relatively high
NADH levels might be anaerobic conditions during
sampling, but otherwise the reason for the observed
discrepancy remains obscure. Finally, the intracellular concentrations
of fructose &phosphate, glucose
6-phosphate, ATP and AMP determined by Habison
et al. [ 1 l] are lower than the values obtained in this
study. This is, however, mainly due to the high value
for the intracellular volume (2.54 ml/g dry weight
[8]) assumed by these authors. When the two-fold
difference in the values used for intracellular volume
is taken into account, the differences in metabolite
levels are minor. A range of values for intracellular
volume of fungi is reported in the literature. For
yeast, a frequently citied value is 3 ml/g dry weight
[l], whereas values for filamentous fungi vary from
1 ml/g dry weight for Claviceps purpurea [ 121 to
2.5 ml/g dry weight for Neurospora crussa [8]. In
our experience the intracellular volume to dry weight
ratio for Aspergillus (Tiger varies with growth conditions (e.g., a value of 2.3 ml/g dry weight was
found for Aspergillus niger mycelium cultured in

301

medium supplemented with trace metals). This is not
surprising in view of the effects on morphology and
cellular composition of Aspergillus niger caused by
cultivation on a manganese-depleted
medium (i.e.,
during citric acid production). Therefore it appears
necessary to determine the intracellular
volume of
the mycelium for the experimental growth conditions
one wants to use for the determination
of metabolites.
Finally, it should be noted that the procedures
described here may also be applied to studies on
metabolic regulation in other filamentous fungi.
