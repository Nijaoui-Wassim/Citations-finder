Abstract
Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) offers speciﬁc advantages over
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) such as the ability to identify and measure a
broader range of compounds with minimal sample preparation. Comparative analysis of LC–MSMS versus GC–MS was performed for urinalysis detection of ﬁve benzodiazepine compounds currently part of the Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) testing
panel; alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nordiazepam and temazepam. In the analyses of internally prepared control urine samples at concentrations around the DDRP administrative
decision point for benzodiazepines (100 ng/mL), both technologies produced comparable results
with average accuracies between 99.7 and 107.3% and average coefﬁcients of variation (%CV)
<9%. Analysis of service member specimens that screened positive for benzodiazepines using
both technologies produced comparable results for all analytes. Different degrees of matrix effect
were observed for all analytes in the LC–MS-MS analysis. However, the effects were controlled by
using deuterated internal standards (ISTDs). Additionally, there was a 39% increase in nordiazepam
mean concentration analyzed by LC–MS-MS due to suppression of the ISTD ion by the ﬂurazepam
metabolite 2-hydroxyethylﬂurazepam. The ease and speed of sample extraction, the broader range
of compounds that can be analyzed and shorter run time make the LC–MS-MS technology a suitable
and expedient alternative conﬁrmation technology for benzodiazepine testing.

Introduction
While gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) has been
widely recognized as the ‘gold standard’ in forensic testing, use of
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) is becoming more common. This is because LC–MS-MS offers several advantages over GC–MS such as quicker and less extensive extraction
procedures and the ability to identify and measure a broader range of
compounds. LC–MS-MS has been authorized for use in federally regulated workplace drug testing (WPDT) since 2008 (1) and its use is also
expanding in the Department of Defense (DoD) Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP), most recently for the analysis of benzodiazepines.
Benzodiazepines remain one of the most widely prescribed classes
of drugs to manage anxiety, insomnia, seizures, muscle relaxation and

a myriad of other conditions. Five benzodiazepines in particular are
among the 200 most commonly prescribed drugs in the USA, alprazolam (Xanax®), lorazepam (Ativan®), clonazepam (Klonopin®), diazepam (Valium®) and temazepam (Restoril®) (2). Benzodiazepines are
commonly abused due in part to their availability and strong sedative
properties. Additionally, benzodiazepines are often used in combination with illicit drugs to enhance their effects making them a target
for drug abuse monitoring programs (3, 4).
In 2012, ﬁve benzodiazepine compounds were added to the DDRP
urinalysis drug testing panel; nordiazepam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam,
oxazepam, lorazepam and temazepam. WPDT platforms commonly
employ an initial screening test followed by a conﬁrmatory test by either GC–MS or LC–MS-MS. However, in high-throughput testing

operations with strict turnaround requirements, such as DDRP laboratories, benzodiazepine detection and measurement by GC–MS
is not temporally optimal as polarity and thermal stability issues can
require extensive sample preparation and long run times.
Some of these issues can be avoided using LC–MS-MS. Unlike GC
analysis, sample volatilization is not required for LC which avoids problems associated with chemical degradation and the formation of new
products common under high heat conditions. Particularly attractive
to high volume laboratory environments is the fact that LC–MS-MS
specimens typically require no derivatization and minimal sample
preparation. In some cases, the specimens can be diluted and directly
injected into the LC–MS-MS, which signiﬁcantly increases throughput.
While previous studies have compared the performance of LC–
MS-MS versus GC–MS for detecting and measuring various drugs
in human urine (1, 5), there are currently no studies that compare
the performance of these two analytical methods in the detection
and analysis of benzodiazepines. In this study, we compared the performance of LC–MS-MS versus GC–MS technology for detecting, in
urine, ﬁve benzodiazepines currently part of the DDRP testing panel.
Benzodiazepine conﬁrmation testing was carried out according to
DoD requirements (6) using GC–MS and LC–MS-MS methods certiﬁed by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES). Both
methods were compared with respect to their linearity, precision,
accuracy and reproducibility of internally prepared quality control
materials in the detection of benzodiazepines.

Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
All solvents used were of analytical grade or better. Sodium acetate buffer, carbonate buffer, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, methanol, ethyl
acetate and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientiﬁc (Fair
Lawn, NJ). β-glucuronidase (type HP-2), anhydrous ethanol, ammonium
hydroxide and N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-N-methyltriﬂuoroacetamide
(MTBSTFA) (w/1% N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilytriﬂuoroacetamide, MTBDMCS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns (CEREX® CLIN II) for
the GC–MS method were purchased from SPEware (San Pedro, CA)
and SPE columns (Clean Screen® XCEL I) for the LC–MS-MS method
were purchased from United Chemical Technologies (Bristol, PA).

Preparation of standards, calibrator, controls
and samples
Reference material of alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AHAL), AHAL-d5,
Oxazepam (OXAZ), OXAZ-d5, Lorazepam (LORA), LORA-d4,
Nordiazepam (NORD), NORD-d5, Temazepam (TEMA) and
TEMA-d5 used in the preparation of control and internal standard
(ISTD) solutions and sample material were obtained from Cerilliant
(Round Rock, TX). Reference material of AHAL, OXAZ, LORA,
NORD and TEMA used in the preparation of the calibrator solution
were obtained from Alltech (Deerﬁeld, IL).
The calibrator was prepared by fortifying 1,000 mL of certiﬁed
drug-free urine with 0.1 mg of AHAL, OXAZ, LORA, NORD and
TEMA, for a ﬁnal concentration of 100 ng/mL. The low quality control (LQC) was prepared by fortifying 1,000 mL of certiﬁed drug-free
urine with 0.04 mg of AHAL, OXAZ, LORA, NORD and TEMA, for
a ﬁnal concentration of 40 ng/mL. The high quality control (HQC)
was prepared by fortifying 500 mL of certiﬁed drug-free urine with
0.5 mg of AHAL, OXAZ, LORA, NORD and TEMA, for a ﬁnal
concentration of 1,000 ng/mL. The blind quality control (BQC) was
prepared by fortifying 1,000 mL of certiﬁed drug-free urine with

Perez et al.
0.125 mg of AHAL, OXAZ, LORA, NORD and TEMA, for a ﬁnal
concentration of 125 ng/mL. The ISTD used for the GC–MS method
was prepared by fortifying 1,000 mL of anhydrous ethanol with 1 mg
of AHAL-d5, OXAZ-d5, NORD-d5 and TEMA-d5, for a ﬁnal concentration of 1,000 ng/mL. The ISTD used for the LC–MS-MS method was prepared by fortifying 1,000 mL of anhydrous ethanol with
0.5 mg of AHAL-d5, OXAZ-d5, LORA-d4, NORD-d5 and
TEMA-d5, for a ﬁnal concentration of 500 ng/mL. All solutions
were aliquoted and stored at −30°C.
Sample material was prepared by fortifying 100 mL of certiﬁed
drug-free urine with AHAL, OXAZ, LORA, NORD and TEMA at
20, 40, 75, 100, 125, 200, 500 and 1,000 ng/mL. The material was
aliquoted into 1 and 0.5 mL aliquots for GC–MS and LC–MS-MS
analysis, respectively. The aliquots were stored at −30°C. A total of
ten independent batches of four replicates of sample material for
each analyte concentration were analyzed by GC–MS and LC–
MS-MS. Calibrators and controls were analyzed with each batch.

GC–MS analysis
Sample preparation and extraction
A 1 mL urine aliquot, 0.100 mL of ISTD (ﬁnal concentration of
100 ng/mL of AHAL-d5, OXAZ-d5 (used for OXAZ and LORA),
NORD-d5 and TEMA-d5), 2 mL 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer ( pH
4.75) and 0.050 mL of β-glucuronidase (type HP-2) were combined.
Tubes were capped, vortexed and incubated for 60 min at 55°C.
Tubes were allowed to cool and then centrifuged for 5 min at
3,000 rpm. Samples were transferred to 3 mL CEREX® CLIN II cartridges, and positive pressure was applied at a rate of 1 mL/min using
CEREX® System 48-11 from SPEware Corporation (Baldwin Park,
CA). The cartridges were then washed with 1 mL of pH 9 carbonate
buffer, followed by 1 mL of water–acetonitrile (80:20), followed by
1 mL of water. The cartridges were dried for 15 min at 50 psi. Analytes were eluted with 1 mL methylene chloride–methanol–ammonium hydroxide (85:10:2) and then evaporated to dryness at 55°C.
Derivatization was accomplished by adding 0.050 mL of ethyl acetate
and 0.050 mL of MTBSTFA (w/1% MTBDMCS) to the dried extracts. Tubes were capped, vortexed and incubated for 20 min at
65°C. Samples were removed from the heat block, allowed to cool
and transferred to the GC–MS.
Instrumental analysis
GC–MS equipment consisted of an Agilent Technologies 7890 GC
coupled to a 5975 MS (Palo Alto, CA). A sample volume of 0.5 µL
was injected into an Agilent HP-ULTRA 1 (15 M, 0.20 mm,
0.33 μm) column, using a helium carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 0.9
mL/min and operating in a pulsed splitless mode. Data analysis was
done using Agilent Drug Analysis Chemstation, version E.02.02.
GC parameters are listed in Supplementary Material, Table SI and
MS analysis was conducted in selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode,
and ions are listed in Supplementary Material, Table SII. Two benzodiazepine dedicated instruments, ID9252 and ID9700, were used for
GC–MS analyses. Three ions for drugs and two ions for ISTD were
monitored for compound identiﬁcation. Furthermore, criteria of
peak retention times within ±1% and ion ratios within ±20% of
batch calibration standard were used.

LC–MS-MS analysis
Sample preparation and extraction
A 0.5 mL urine aliquot, 0.100 mL ISTD solution (ﬁnal concentration
of 100 ng/mL of AHAL-d5, OXAZ-d5, LORA-d4, NORD-d5 and

TEMA-d5), 1 mL 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer ( pH 4.75) and
0.025 mL of β-glucuronidase (type HP-2) were combined. Tubes
were capped, vortexed and incubated for 60 min at 55°C. Tubes were
allowed to cool and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm. Samples were
transferred to 3 mL UCT Clean Screen® XCEL I cartridges, and positive pressure was applied at a rate of 1 mL/min. The cartridges were
dried for 1 min at 25 psi. The cartridges were then washed with
1 mL of methylene chloride, followed by an additional 5 min dry
down at 50 psi. Analytes were eluted with 1 mL ethyl acetate–ammonium hydroxide (100:2) and then evaporated to dryness at 55°C. Samples were reconstituted with 0.200 mL of mobile phase (0.1% formic
acid–acetonitrile; 75:25) and transferred to the LC–MS-MS.
Instrumental analysis
LC–MS-MS equipment consisted of a Waters ACQUITY LC (Milford,
MA). A sample volume of 10 µL was injected into an ACQUITY
UPLC BEH C18 (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) column coupled to a Waters
Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray source (Milford, MA). Data analysis was performed using
Waters MassLynx and TargetLynx, version 4.1 SCN805, with
smoothing = mean, iterations = 2 and width = 3. The mobile phase
components were (A) 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile. The LC
parameters are listed in Supplementary Material, Table SIII. The analyses were conducted in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode
using the MS–MS conditions listed in Supplementary Material,
Table SIV with cone voltages and collision energies optimized. The
same compound identiﬁcation criteria were employed for LC–
MS-MS with the exception of the retention time, which was ±2%.
Matrix effects
Matrix effects (ME) were assessed using the method described by
Matuszewski, et al. (7). Two concentrations were used in the evaluation: one at the LQC concentration of 40 ng/mL and one at the
administrative decision point of 100 ng/mL. Three sets of samples
were prepared. The (A) samples contained the target analytes fortiﬁed
into the mobile phase. The (B) samples contained the target analytes
fortiﬁed into negative urine prior to extraction. The (C) samples contained the target analytes fortiﬁed into urine after extraction. All the
samples also contained 100 ng/mL of ISTD. The mean area responses
for the target analytes and the corresponding ISTD in samples A, B
and C were evaluated across ten different lots of negative urine.
Urine used in the ME studies were randomly selected from service
member specimens that screened negative for all drugs tested in the
DDRP panel. ME was calculated by taking the ratio of the urine fortiﬁed with target analytes after extraction divided by the mobile phase
fortiﬁed with target analytes (C/A) × 100. Resulting values <100 indicate ionization suppression and values >100 indicate ionization enhancement. Recovery was calculated by taking the ratio of urine
fortiﬁed with target analytes prior to extraction divided by urine fortiﬁed with target analytes after extraction (B/C) × 100. The process efﬁciency was calculated by taking the ratio of urine fortiﬁed with target
analytes prior to extraction divided by the mobile phase fortiﬁed with
target analytes (B/A) × 100.

Limit of detection, limit of quantitation and upper limit
of linearity
The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were established for GC–MS and LC–MS-MS methods. For each analyte,
four replicates of the concentration range of 2.0–40.0 ng/mL were
quantitated. The LOD was deﬁned as the lowest concentration
where the coefﬁcient of variation of the replicates was ≤10%, all

ion ratios were ±20% of the calibrator and retention times were within
±1 for GC or ±2% for LC of the averages established by the calibrator.
The LOQ was deﬁned as the lowest concentration where the mean
concentration of the replicates was within ±20% of the target concentration with coefﬁcient of variation ≤10%, all ion ratios were ±20% of
the calibrator and retention times were within ±1 for GC or ±2% for
LC of the averages established by the calibrator. Also, all peaks met
resolution and symmetry requirements. The upper limit of linearity
(ULOL) was assigned based on ten times the benzodiazepine DDRP
administrative decision point of 100 ng/mL.

Method comparison
Internally prepared sample solutions containing AHAL, OXAZ,
LORA, NORD and TEMA at 20, 40, 75, 100, 125, 200, 500 and
1,000 ng/mL were analyzed by GC–MS and LC–MS-MS. The methods were compared with respect to their linearity, precision, accuracy
and reproducibility.

Interferences
Interference samples were prepared by fortifying certiﬁed drug-free
urine to a concentration of 40 ng/mL of the target compounds and
5,000 ng/mL of the interferant compounds indicated in Supplementary Material, Table SV: (i) structurally similar compounds; (ii) a
mix of over the counter (OTC) drugs and (iii) mix of ‘club’ drugs.
The interference samples were then analyzed in ﬁve replicates by
GC–MS and LC–MS-MS technologies. The interference effect was
evaluated based on quantitation values within ±20% of the target concentration and acceptable chromatography.

Service member urine specimens side-by-side
comparison
Benzodiazepine concentrations in service member urine specimens
were measured using both GC–MS and LC–MS-MS and then compared to assess agreement between the two conﬁrmation technologies.
Urine specimens used in this evaluation were anonymously donated
from US service members submitted to NDSL Jacksonville for drug
screening in accordance with the Military Personnel Drug Abuse Testing Program (MPDATP). As per DDRP procedures, specimens were
aliquoted and screened by immunoassay (IA). Screening was conducted on a Roche/Hitachi (Indianapolis, IN) DAT 2400 immunoanalyzer. Urine was screened for benzodiazepines using the Microgenics
Corporation CEDIA® (Fremont, CA) DAU immunoassay kit
(1775561). Oxazepam in urine at 200 ng/mL was used as reference
calibrator using a two-point calibration. Aliquots that screened at or
above the cutoff for benzodiazepines were extracted and conﬁrmed for
benzodiazepines using both GC–MS and LC–MS-MS as described
previously. All identiﬁers were removed prior to testing.

Statistical analysis
The average, standard deviation (SD), coefﬁcient of variation (%CV),
accuracy and mean difference were calculated using Microsoft Excel
2010 (Seattle, WA). Evaluation of the linear regression with analysis
of variance (ANOVA) of the regression ﬁt, one-way ANOVA for precision analysis, and Student’s t-test analyses were conducted using
Minitab 17 (State College, PA).

the LOD values also met the criteria to be established as the LOQ
value. For LORA, NORD and TEMA the LC–MS-MS instrument attained lower LOD and LOQ values, ranging from 1.96 to 2.15 ng/mL
with CVs between 3.4 and 8.1%, respectively, than the GC–MS instrument, value ranges of 6.13–26.30 ng/mL with CVs between 0.4
and 4.8%, respectively. For AHAL and OXAZ, the LOD and LOQ
values were equivalent for both technologies.

Method comparison of GC–MS and LC–MS-MS
Independent sets of samples containing four replicates of the target
concentrations: 20, 40, 75, 100, 125, 200, 500 and 1,000 ng/mL
were analyzed by GC–MS (10 sets) and LC–MS-MS (9 sets) using
a single point calibration at the DDRP administrative decision
point of 100 ng/mL. Comparison of GC–MS and LC–MS-MS measured concentrations and descriptive statistics are presented in
Table II. Of particular interest is the comparison of both technologies
at concentrations around the DDRP administrative decision point of
100 ng/mL. At concentrations of 75, 100 and 125 ng/mL, GC–MS
technology had an average accuracy of 102% with CVs < 5% for
all analytes across the three concentrations, while the LC–MS-MS
technology average accuracy was a comparable 105% with CVs <
7% (Table II). Qualitatively, LC–MS-MS measured concentrations
demonstrated a greater spread as compared with GC–MS measurements. However, the % difference between GC–MS and LC–
MS-MS at measured concentrations around the DDRP administrative decision point of 100 ng/mL ranged between 0.14 and 5.07%
(Table II).
Further, GC–MS analysis across all concentrations for all
analytes had a within-run precision average CV < 4%, and a
between-run precision average CV < 5% (Supplementary Material,
Table SVI). When the measured concentration was compared with
the target concentration, the average accuracy for all analytes ranged
between 99.3 and 103.8%, with % CVs ranging from 2.93 to
4.93%. Regression analysis was also used to compare measured
versus target concentration following the methods used by Stout
et al. (1, 5). Regression comparison to target concentrations and
ANOVA analysis of the line of ﬁt showed that all analytes had a
slope close to the ideal value of 1.000 (r 2 > 0.993), which was

signiﬁcantly different from 0.000 with all intercepts equal to zero
with the exception of NORD and TEMA, suggesting a signiﬁcant deviation in measured versus target concentration for these two analytes. However, in both cases, the intercepts were below the LOQ
established for the two GC–MS instruments used for the analysis
(Table I). Further, the within-run precision and between-run precision average CVs were below 2 and 4%, respectively, with average
accuracies of 100.8 for NORD and 99.3 for TEMA (Supplementary
Material, Table SVI).
LC–MS-MS analysis across all concentrations for all analytes had
a within-run precision average CV of <4%, and a between-run precision average CV of <6% (Supplementary Table SVII). The average accuracy for all analytes ranged between 102.5 and 105.9%, with %
CVs ranging between 3.77 and 7.14%. Regression comparison to target concentrations and ANOVA analysis of the line of ﬁt showed that
all analytes had a slope close to the ideal value of 1.000 (r 2 > 0.992),
which was signiﬁcantly different from 0.000 with all intercepts equal
to zero with the exception of LORA. Suggesting a signiﬁcant deviation
in measured versus target concentration for LORA. However, LORA
within-run precision and between-run precision CV averages were
below 3 and 4%, respectively, with an average accuracy of 105.1%
(Supplementary Material, Table SVII).

Evaluation of ME
Table III summarizes the LC–MS-MS ME for all analytes at 40 ng/mL
and at the DDRP administrative decision point for benzodiazepines of
100 ng/mL in 10 different human urine matrices. For all analytes except NORD, ME led to target ion enhancement ranging from 2 to
52% at both concentrations. Only for NORD at 100 ng/mL did the
ME cause target ion suppression by <1%. Target ion recovery (RE)
and process efﬁciency (PE) ranged between 44–83% and 44–95%, respectively. For all analytes at both concentrations, target and ISTD ion
responses were similar, suggesting that urine ME effects were appropriately controlled by including compound matched deuterated ISTDs
in each analysis. This was further demonstrated by the quantitation
analysis of C samples (target analytes fortiﬁed into urine after extraction) reported in Table III. For both concentrations, accuracies for
AHAL, OXAZ, LORA, NORD and TEMA ranged between 98.3
and 102.5% with CVs <5%.

Interference study
Results for the interference study are summarized in Table IV. Deviations between target and mean measured concentrations were within
±20% for GC–MS analysis for all analytes. For LC–MS-MS analysis,
deviations between target and mean measured concentrations were
within ±20% for all analytes, with the exception of NORD in the
presence of 2-hydroxy-ethylﬂurazepam (2HEF). In comparing GC–
MS to LC–MS-MS results, only discrepancies greater than 10% were
considered of practical interest. GC–MS and LC–MS-MS measured
mean concentrations for LORA and NORD differed more than 10%
when 2HEF was fortiﬁed into 40 ng/mL of these analytes. For
LORA, 2HEF caused a 15% difference in measured concentrations
between technologies. For NORD, 2HEF increased the LC–
MS-MS mean quantitation value by 39% as compared with the results obtained using GC–MS. Supplementary Material, Figure S1
shows an LC–MS-MS response of a representative sample of
NORD at 40 ng/mL containing the interferant 2HEF. In the interference sample, NORD ISTD ion response was suppressed by 36% in
comparison to the ISTD ion response in the LQC at 40 ng/mL. In
contrast, similar responses were observed for the interference sample

and the low quality control NORD target quant ion. These ﬁndings
are consistent with the observed difference in NORD measured
concentration between GC–MS and LC–MS-MS. Although scientifically interesting, the impact of 2HEF on NORD quantitation is of
minimal concern for DDRP laboratory operations since the concentration used for the interference study was comparable to urine concentrations found in fatal cases (8), additionally ﬂurazepam is not a
commonly prescribed benzodiazepine (9). However, the effect of
2HEF on NORD quantitation should be taken into consideration
during method development if the same parental and transition
ions are chosen.
Successful analysis of TEMA (40 ng/mL) by GC–MS was not
accomplished in three of ﬁve replicates containing club drug mixture.
In each case, the analysis did not meet GC–MS chromatographic

criteria for the qualiﬁer ion 359 m/z. No problems were encountered
with the analysis of TEMA by LC–MS-MS.

and LC–MS-MS
Table V summarizes the results for service member specimens analyzed
for benzodiazepines using both GC–MS and LC–MS-MS. The regression analysis suggests a linear relationship between both technologies
for all analytes. A t-test analysis found no signiﬁcant difference (P <
0.05) between GC–MS and LC–MS-MS quantitation values for
NORD, OXAZ, LORA and AHAL. In contrast, TEMA results differed
signiﬁcantly between technologies (P = 0.025), however the mean percent difference between both technologies was found to be <3% (data

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that LC–MS-MS technology is comparable
with GC–MS and produced conﬁrmatory testing results that meet
DDRP guidelines and criteria for urine drug testing without the extensive sample preparation required for GC–MS analysis. Both technologies produced comparable results at concentrations around the DDRP
administrative decision point for benzodiazepines (100 ng/mL), with
excellent accuracy and precision across the range of concentrations
evaluated. Analysis of service member specimens that screened positive for benzodiazepines using both technologies produced comparable results for all analytes. Different degrees of ME were observed
for all analytes in the LC–MS-MS analysis. However, these effects
were controlled for by using deuterated ISTD resulting in minimal impact on measured versus target quantitation values. Interference in
NORD LC–MS-MS quantitation occurred in the presence of ﬂurazepam metabolite 2HEF resulting in a 39% increase in NORD mean
measured concentration from suppression of the sample ISTD ion
by 2HEF. However, this effect occurred at 2HEF concentrations that
were 125 times greater than the sample and in quantities higher than
the literature suggests would be physiologically realistic concentrations. This study conﬁrmed that LC–MS-MS technology is a suitable
and expedient alternative for DDRP benzodiazepine conﬁrmation
testing. LC–MS-MS offers the additional advantages of ease and
speed of sample extraction, shorter run times and potentially a broader range of compounds that can be analyzed as compared with
GC–MS.
