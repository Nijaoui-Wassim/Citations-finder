To improve the clinical course of diseases, more accurate diagnostic and assessment methods are required as early as possible.
In order to achieve this, metabolomics offers new opportunities for biomarker discovery in complex diseases and may provide
pathological understanding of diseases beyond traditional technologies. It is the systematic analysis of low-molecular-weight
metabolites in biological samples and has become an important tool in clinical research and the diagnosis of human disease and has
been applied to discovery and identification of the perturbed pathways. It provides a powerful approach to discover biomarkers in
biological systems and offers a holistic approach with the promise to clinically enhance diagnostics. When carried out properly, it
could provide insight into the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of diseases, help to identify patients at risk of disease,
and predict the response to specific treatments. Currently, metabolomics has become an important tool in clinical research and the
diagnosis of human disease and becomes a hot topic. This review will highlight the importance and benefit of metabolomics for
identifying biomarkers that accurately screen potential biomarkers of diseases.

1. Introduction
Metabolomics, an omic science, deals with the global assessment of the metabolites present in a biological system to evaluate the progress of the disease, select potential biomarkers,
and provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology [1].
Recent improvements in metabolomics technologies reveal
the unequivocal value of metabolomics tools in biomarker
discovery, gene-function analysis, systems biology, and diagnostic platforms. Because metabolites represent the downstream expression of genome, transcriptome, and proteome,
they can closely reflect the phenotype of an organism at
a specific time. Analyzing metabolic differences between
unperturbed and perturbed pathways could provide insight
into underlying disease pathology and disease prognosis
and diagnosis. Additionally, small molecule metabolites can
provide mechanistic insights into novel biomarkers for diseases, given the limitations of the current traditional markers
[2]. Metabolomics may provide biomarkers useful for identification of early stage diseases, potentially addressing an
important clinical need.

The development of metabolomic technologies holds the
promise to significantly improve diagnosis, unravel more
appropriate therapeutic targets, and enable more precise
prognosis of disease development. The potential of this
approach for clinical diagnostics is huge, since only minimal
biological preparation is necessary. In recent years, the development of instrumental systems, such as high-resolution
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass
spectrometry (MS), ultraperformance liquid chromatography, and more sophisticated bioinformatics and analytical
techniques, has enabled more comprehensive coverage of the
metabolome [3]. Advances in mass spectrometry coupled
with chromatography have particularly improved both the
efficiency and reliability of metabolic profiling and represent
one of the major platforms in clinical fields [4]. Bioinformation derived from these techniques could provide accurate
and clinically useful diagnostic capability for the management of diseases at the metabolic level in concentration [5].
With advantages of high throughput, high sensitivity, and
high accuracy, metabolomics shows great potential and value
in disease treatment.

2
Early detection is the most effective way to improve the
clinical outcome of diseases. Emerging metabolomics provides a powerful platform for discovering novel biomarkers
and biochemical pathways to improve early diagnosis.
Metabolites that are important indicators of physiological or pathological states can provide information for the
identification of early biomarkers for disease and help to
understand its progression [6]. Metabolomics has the potential to generate novel noninvasive diagnostic tests and provides a unique insight into established and novel metabolic
pathways, which are simple and cost-effective yet retain high
sensitivity and specificity characteristics [7]. Because of this
potential, the objective of this paper is to find metabolites
that can be used as a clinical test for the early diagnosis and
monitoring of the disease and the outcome of therapy and
discuss its significance in depth in the postgenomic era and
it highlights clinical associations and potential challenges.
Moreover, an overview of most interesting recent biomarker
discovery publications is provided to highlight the clinical
applications of metabolomic techniques used for bioanalytical data interpretation.

2. Metabolomics for Biomarker Discovery
Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies.
The early detection of diseases is pivotal for successful patient
treatment and management. With the recent emergence
of new technologies, the biomarker discovery has been
the subject of intense research and activity. The alterations
of metabolites in biofluids are indicators of variations in
physiology or pathology. Metabolomics is a well-established
rapidly developing research field involving quantitative and
qualitative metabolite assessment within biological systems
[8–11]. The metabolome represents the endpoint of the omics
cascade and is also the closest point in the cascade to
the phenotype. Therefore, metabolome analysis can be a
useful approach for finding effective diagnostic markers and
examining unknown pathological conditions. Metabolomics
involves the establishment of relationships between phenotype and a metabolic signature, which are key aspects of
biological function, and is a powerful technique for the elucidation of biochemical pathways to improve diagnosis and
therapy [12, 13]. It has the potential to provide insight into the
pathogenesis of disease states and discover diagnostic markers for therapeutic targets. An advantage of this approach or
the predictive power of metabolomics performed better in
both sensitivity and specificity and may be of advantage in the
future for the determination of biomarkers [14]. Moreover,
metabolic profiling is highly simple, accurate, and specific
and should prove equally valuable in metabolomic research
applications.

3. Metabolomics in Diagnosis
Early diagnosis is the key to the effective treatment of disease.
The detection of disease biomarkers plays a critical role not
only in disease early diagnosis, but also in classification and

BioMed Research International
disease progression or assessment prognosis and treatment
response. Analysis of the key metabolites has become an
important role to monitor the state of biological organisms.
Metabolomics is an emerging analytical technique for systemic determination of metabolite profiles, which is useful
for understanding the biochemical changes in related diseases
[15]. It is increasingly being applied towards the identification
of biomarkers for disease diagnosis and risk prediction [16].
Recent developments have suggested metabolomics is the
relatively new field in bioinformatics that uses measurements
on metabolite abundance as a tool for disease diagnosis
and other medical purposes [17]. It holds promise for early
diagnosis and increases choice of therapy and the identification of new metabolic pathways that could potentially
be targeted in diseases [18]. Owing to the complexity and
volume of the data generated by the advanced technologies
in metabolomics, pattern recognition methods have become
predominant in the medical sciences and may be suitable for
certain diagnostics medical applications. It is hoped that the
information derived from metabolite profiling will make it
possible to suggest individualized therapies that more effectively treat disease. Improvements in analytical technologies
have made it possible to rapidly determine the concentrations
of thousands of metabolites in any biological sample, which
has resulted in metabolome analysis being applied to various
clinical studies. Advent of advanced metabolomics technologies and associated bioinformatics development is bringing
these goals into focus. Metabolomics technology is still under
development and is a promising tool for elucidating biological
pathways and discovering clinical biomarkers, strengthening
the efforts for optimizing both the prevention and treatment
of disease.

4. Application in Disease Biomarker Discovery
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality and is a major epidemic worldwide. Unfortunately,
current biomarkers for early disease are limited because they
are either invasive, time-consuming, or expensive. A study
combining high-resolution mass spectrometry and chemometrics for the analysis of AD was undertaken [19]. Predictive
power of the metabolomics approach for distinguishing AD
cases was confirmed, reaching 100% diagnostic accuracy. A
nontargeted metabolomic approach was developed to examine metabolic differences subjects with different cognitive
status related to AD progression [20]. Choline, dimethylarginine, arginine, valine, and so forth were identified as
possible progression biomarkers. Their predictive values were
higher than those reported with classical AD biomarkers.
Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but
none can currently detect preclinical AD disease with the
required sensitivity and specificity. Importantly, Mapstone
et al. described our metabolomic approach to detecting
preclinical AD disease in a group of cognitively normal older
adults [21]. They discovered and validated a set of ten lipids
from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to
either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or AD within a 23-year timeframe with over 90% accuracy. Such characteristic
biomarkers will more accurately reflect AD pathophysiology,

BioMed Research International
ultimately increasing the chances of success of preventive
treatments.
Late diagnosis of hepatocarcinoma (HCC) is one of
the most primary factors for the poor survival of patients.
Thereby, identification of sensitive biomarkers for HCC early
and accurate diagnosis is of great importance. In a study,
Xiao et al. compared metabolite levels in sera of HCC
and cirrhosis patients by metabolomics [22]. They verified
the identities of selected putative identifications including
glycolic acid and glycodeoxycholic acid. In a study done by
Wang et al., thirteen potential biomarkers were identified
and there were significant disturbances of key metabolic
pathways, such as organic acids, phospholipids, fatty acids,
bile acids, and gut flora metabolism in HCC patients [23].
In addition, glycochenodeoxycholic acid was suggested to
be an important indicator for HCC diagnosis and disease
prognosis. Metabolite signatures could be an efficient and
convenient tool for early diagnosis and screening of HCC.
Tan et al. used a nontargeted metabolomics method to
find the potential biomarkers from the HCC disease model
and test their usefulness in early human HCC diagnosis
[24]. It was found that three marker metabolites (taurocholic acid, lysophosphoethanolamine 16 : 0, and lysophosphatidylcholine 22 : 5) achieved a sensitivity of 80.5% and
a specificity of 80.1%, which are better than those of 𝛼fetoprotein. Serum metabolites of the HCC patients and
healthy controls were also investigated using the improved
metabolomics [14]. 1-Methyladenosine that was identified as
the characteristic metabolite for HCC exhibited significant
improved sensitivity. Metabolite profiling of human HCC
was performed by metabolomics in conjunction with multivariate statistical analyses [25]. Forty-three serum metabolites and 31 urinary metabolites were identified in HCC
patients involving several key metabolic pathways such as
bile acids, urea cycle, and methionine metabolism. These
studies showed that metabolomics approach is a promising
screening tool for the diagnosis of HCC patients. Shao and
colleague developed a urinary pseudotargeted method based
on LC-MS, which was applied to cirrhosis (CIR) and HCC
investigation [26]. It was found that urinary nucleosides,
bile acids, citric acid, and several amino acids were significantly changed in disease groups compared with the
controls, featuring the dysregulation of purine metabolism,
energy metabolism, and amino metabolism in liver diseases. Furthermore, butyrylcarnitine (carnitine C4:0) and
hydantoin-5-propionic acid were defined as combinational
markers to distinguish HCC from CIR. In a study, a novel
steroid hormone metabolomic method based on liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with logistic
regression analysis was applied to investigate the steroid
hormone disorders and to screen potential urinary steroid
hormone biomarkers of early HCC [27]. Logistic regression
analysis reveals that a panel of epitestosterone and allotetrahydrocortisol displayed excellent diagnostic capability for
distinguishing early HCC. Determination of the metabolic
alterations associated with the presence of HCC can
improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of this
cancer.

Traditional clinical biomarkers of renal function are
not sensitive enough and only increase significantly after
the presence of substantial chronic kidney diseases (CKD).
Metabolomics approach was applied to establish a human
CKD serum metabolic profile and the significant endogenous
metabolites that contributed to distinguishing of CKD in
different stages [28]. Based on these metabolites, the model
for diagnosing patients with CKD achieved the sensitivity and
specificity of 100% and may provide useful information for
the early diagnosis of CKD. It illustrated that serum metabolic
profile was altered in response to renal dysfunction and the
progression of CKD. Several markers have been confirmed
across multiple studies to detect CKD earlier than traditional clinical chemical and histopathological methods [29].
The application of metabolomics in CKD studies provides
researchers with the opportunity to gain new insights into the
pathophysiological mechanisms.
In search of new diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian
endometriosis, Vouk et al. used a hypothesis-generating
targeted metabolomics approach [30]. Eight lipid metabolites
were identified as endometriosis-associated biomarkers. A
model containing hydroxysphingomyelin 16 : 1 and the ratio
between phosphatidylcholine 36 : 2 and ether-phospholipid
34 : 2 resulted in a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity
of 84.3%. Results suggest that endometriosis is associated
with elevated levels of sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholines that may contribute to the suppression of apoptosis
and affect lipid-associated signalling pathways. Metabolite
profiling was used to select the metabolites to be used for
the noninvasive diagnosis of liver-stagnation and spleendeficiency syndrome- (LSS-) type disease [11]. Twelve urinary differential metabolites contributing to the complete
separation of LSS patients from matched healthy controls
were identified involving several key metabolic pathways
such as pentose, cysteine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan,
and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Importantly, 4 metabolite
markers were effective for the diagnosis of human LSS, with
an achieved sensitivity of 93.0%. Earlier detection of patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) could improve
their treatment and survival outcomes. In a study, Bertini et
al. had used NMR to profile serum metabolome in patients
with mCRC and determine whether a disease signature may
exist that is strong enough to predict overall survival (OS)
[31]. In the training set, NMR metabolomic profiling could
discriminate patients with mCRC from healthy subjects with
accuracy of 100%. In the validation set, 96.7% of subjects were
correctly classified. A LC-MS based method has been carried
out in conjunction with multivariate analysis to discriminate
the global serum profiles of renal cell carcinoma patients [32].
As a result, 30 potential biomarkers for renal cell carcinoma
are identified.
Jung et al. applied a NMR metabolomics approach to
investigate the altered metabolic pattern in sera from patients
with asthma and sought to identify the potential biomarkers [33]. Sera of asthma patients were characterized by
increased levels of methionine, glutamine, and histidine
and by decreased levels of formate, methanol, acetate,
choline, o-phosphocholine, arginine, and glucose. In addition, potential biomarkers showed strong predictive power,

4
and the presence of asthma in external validation models
was predicted with high accuracy. Diagnostic and therapeutic
biomarkers useful for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(ESCC) have the ability to increase the long-term survival
of cancer patients. In a pilot study, metabolomics study
was originally carried out to determine global alterations
in the metabolic profiles and find biomarkers potentially
applicable to diagnosis [34]. Finally, 18 most significantly
altered plasma metabolites in ESCC patients were tentatively identified as lysophosphatidylcholines, fatty acids, Lcarnitine, acylcarnitines, organic acids, and a sterol metabolite. Moreover, variation of these three potential biomarkers
was investigated over the treatment course and may be useful
in diagnosing and monitoring therapeutic responses and
predicting outcomes. In a study, Lam and coworker exploit
metabolomic profiling for cancer biomarker discovery for
diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions [35]. Insignificant
markers were filtered out using a metabolome-wide significance level. The diagnostic performance of FFA 18 : 1-toceramide (d18 : 1/16 : 0) ratio supports use for diagnosis of
malignant pleural effusions. Metabolomic profiling was performed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and forty-eight metabolites were identified in the serum
samples [36]. Itaconic acid was found to be significantly
more abundant in women who subsequently developed
gestational diabetes mellitus and may have potential as a
novel biomarker in early pregnancy to predict the subsequent
development of gestational diabetes mellitus. These results
demonstrate that robust metabolomics has the potential as a
noninvasive strategy and promising screening tool to evaluate
the potential of these metabolites in the early diagnosis of
patients and provides new insight into pathophysiological
mechanisms.

5. Current Trends and Future Perspectives
Many diseases result in characteristic changes in the metabolite profiles of fluids prior to development of clinical
symptoms. These metabolites are often useful diagnostics
biomarkers. Identifying biomarkers for the early detection
of diseases will result in more efficient treatments, reduction in suffering, and lower mortality rates [37]. There is
a dire need for sensitive and more affordable diagnostic
tools to develop effective therapies. Besides the traditional
techniques to investigate biomarker profiles, metabolomics
appears to be an important tool to gain information
on low-molecular-weight metabolites present in biofluids.
Additionally, the high-throughput nature of metabolomics
makes it ideal to perform biomarker screens for diseases
or follow drug efficacy [38]. Metabolomics strategies to
analyze, understand, and construct the metabolic pathways
open the window of opportunity in a very cost-effective
manner.
One of the major challenges in metabolomics is validation
of fingerprint molecules to identify specifically perturbed
pathways in metabolic aberrations. The identification and
interpretation of metabolic biomarkers is also a challenging
task. In this context, pathway-based approaches have increasingly become a key technology in metabolomics allowing

BioMed Research International
capture of complex interactions in biological systems, with
high-throughput evaluation of a large number of metabolites
[39, 40]. While the past decade has seen great advancements
in metabolomics research producing potential biomarkers,
most of the identified biomarkers have failed to replace
existing clinical tests. To become a clinically approved test,
a potential biomarker should be confirmed and validated
using hundreds of specimens and should be reproducible,
specific, and sensitive. The quest for an ideal biomarker in
disease is still underway. Since at present we cannot apply
the application of the perfect marker, maybe combining
different molecules will provide information compensating
for the shortcoming of individual tests. The accumulated
clinical research experience and the continuing exploration
of the metabolomics ensure that there will be no shortage
of newly discovered candidate biomarker molecules for the
future. In the last decade, metabolomics has contributed
substantially to our understanding of different diseases. The
development of metabolome analysis will aid the discovery of
novel biomarkers, hopefully leading to the early detection of
various diseases [18, 41–43].

6. Conclusions
Metabolomics is an “omic” science that is now emerging
with the purpose of elaborating a comprehensive analysis
of the metabolome, which is the complete set of small
molecules intermediates. Metabolome is a data-rich source
of information concerning all the metabolites in a biofluid,
which could indicate early biological changes to the host due
to perturbations in disease. Metabolomics therefore has great
potential for improving diagnosis, therapeutic treatment,
and care of disease. In the past decade, metabolomics has
already proved to be useful for the characterization of several
pathological conditions and offers promises as a clinical tool.
In future work, the potential biomarkers should be further
validated with a large enough patient cohort to achieve earlier
diagnosis. Moreover, the improvement of patient prognosis
and care will be another aim of such investigations. In the era
of personalized medicine with more and more patient specific
targeted therapies being used, we need reliable and sensitive
biomarkers to track the disease and to develop therapies
during the course of treatment.
